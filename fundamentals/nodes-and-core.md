# Nodes & Core

## NODE

Nexus is a distributed network of computers running the software (known as nodes) that can verify blocks and transaction data. Participants need a software application, known as core, on the computer to "run" a node.

### NODE TYPES

The Nexus core can be configured to run as different types of nodes that consume data differently. The Nexus core can run two different types of nodes - full and lite.

### Full Node

* Stores full blockchain data.
* Participates in block validation, verifies all blocks and states.
* All states can be derived from a full node.
* Serves the network and provides data on request.

### Lite Node

* Stores the block headers and sig chain data and requests everything else.
* Can verify the validity of the data against the state roots in the block headers.
* Useful for low capacity devices, such as embedded devices, IoT and mobile phones, which can't afford to store gigabytes of blockchain data.

## CORE <a href="#evm" id="evm"></a>

Core is the software implementation of the protocols which power the Nexus network. Network participants run the core on a computer which connects and communicates to other computers running the core via the intenet to form a single entity which is the Nexus network.

#### The Core Contains:

Lower Level Library (LLL) which is a series of templates for crypto, database and protocol. Base templates for the TAO framework, which will inherit these templates and create higher level functionality.

Tritium Amine Obsidian (TAO) - The protocols which govern the Nexus network, utilizing the LLL as base templates for Tritium, Amine, and Obsidian feature sets.
