# TAO Framework

Blockchains today are still in its infancy, growing and innovating at a rapid pace. To emerge as a unique and fully decentralised solution among its peers, Nexus needs to incorporate the most innovate technology without sacrificing decentralization.&#x20;

Nexus started out as a clone of Peercoin and in 2016 embarked on an upgrade path to a ground breaking framework called TAO. Nexus views the blockchain as a foundational element of a larger framework. The TAO Framework â€” named for the three phases of deployment: Tritium, Amine, and Obsidian.&#x20;

Upon completion of the TAO framework Nexus blockchain will be a 3-Dimensional chain based on a seven-layered software stack modular design, which can scale as needed by the network.&#x20;

**Tritum:** It is the foundation of the TAO framework, and along the way a few things were added to the Tritium roadmap which was renamed as Tritium++. Tritium has been running on mainnet from 12th November, 2019 when the first Tritium block was mined.

**Tritium++:** This will bring in the developer tools, mobile wallets and pooled staking and upon completion Tritium will be the fastest single chain. Tritium++ update will be done in phases and will have the developer tools and contracts to build on Nexus.

**Amine:** It will add the x and z dimensions, adding L1 state shards that process on a single dimensional chain, grouped as a reference hash like a tritium transaction. Amine will be voluntary to process in shard mode, so network participants will opt-in to a shard to process there.

**Obsidian:** Obsidian is the bow that wraps it all together by adding full L2/L3 validation as a full 3DC, rather than processing on shards that are referenced in the merkle root of a classical single dimensional block.
