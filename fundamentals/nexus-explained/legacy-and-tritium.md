# Legacy and Tritium

## Legacy

Nexus was born as Coinshield (CSD) on 23rd September, 2019 with the Peercoin codebase and started as a cryptocurrency project. The crypto market was innovating by leaps and bounds and Ethereum, brought smart-contracts to blockchain, which was a massive step to. Nexus has a few innovations of its own, but waited to see how things will unfurl.

In 2016 CSD was renamed to Nexus (NXS), and then the team laid a research initiative for a major upgrade to Nexus which today is known as Tritium. The chain before the Tritium upgrade is called the Legacy chain and this chain still runs linked to the Tritium chain, to ensure all the legacy coin holders can migrate to Tritium Chain.

The legacy chain will see a demise at a later stage.

## Tritium

On 12th November, 2019 the Nexus network was upgraded to Tritium protocol a part of the TAO framework. This changed a crypto currency (legacy) chain to the most innovative protocol platform. The legacy chain is still valid but gets its security from Tritium and users can still transact between them. The legacy code was completely rewritten from scratch to be compatible with Tritium. Tritium was written from the ground up as the code is all new, and this is very evident by it's disparate architecture.&#x20;

The upgrade to the Nexus network called the TAO framework, will be carried out in 3 phases Tritium, Amine & Obsidian (TAO). Tritium is complete, but some of the features and some additional features were bundled together as Tritium++ which will be done in three phases. Amine and Obsidian will make the Nexus blockchain into a 3-dimensional chain which will solve scalability. Imagine Tritium being the single fast lane, Amine and Obsidian will create multiple parallel Tritium lanes in 3-dimension.&#x20;
