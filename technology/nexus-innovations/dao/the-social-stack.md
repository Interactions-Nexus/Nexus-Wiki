# The Social Stack

We would like to introduce our ‘Social Stack’ concept, that provides the tools for the formation of a ‘meritocracy’, meaning that everyone has an equal opportunity to be voted into their level of capability, and reward is based on acceptance of responsibility across different roles. This technology will enable groups that share similar knowledge and interests to vote together on subject matters that they have expertise in. By encapsulating values that are alike into groups that determine a smaller part of the entire decision itself, we can improve the overall reflection of value in a system as a whole. Our social stack concept utilizes Fibonacci number sequences for the expansion of the groups through each layer, and is designed to be extensible to accommodate varying organizational sizes. This stack is a ‘bottom up’ design, meaning that all contracts allocated are accountable to the most fundamental peer group: The Community.

This social stack enforces community votes through cryptographic verification. It is designed to bring the highest integrity to an organization, while maintaining the ability to ‘socially scale’.

**Community —** The community is the foundational layer to the stack, which is responsible for global contract level decisions, which will be governed by the DAO voting groups. This layer has the power to appoint or remove any contracts from on-chain funding.

**Contract** — The contract layer is the layer that represents each individual type of contract: Ambassador or Developer. Ambassador contracts are reserved for individuals or teams that facilitate communication between developers, community, and the greater world. Developers are responsible for producing verifiable results that can be audited and reviewed.

**Allocation —** The allocation layer is responsible for deciding on the internal budget allocation for the organization. It is a collection of up to three individual groups which include a board of directors as one group, that only carries voting power if the other groups are unable to come to consensus. This layer purely deals with financial decisions.

**Strategy —** The strategy layer is the layer that is important for overall organizational strategy, that defines longer term goals, aspirations, budgets, etc. This group is composed of a maximum of five individuals, with each individual being selected by their Creative layer for Strategic representation.

**Creative —** The creative layer is the ‘task defining’ layer that takes the higher level strategies, and expands them into a series of tasks and pursuits. This group is composed of a maximum of eight individuals, with each being selected by their Working layer for Creative representation.

**Working —** The working layer is the ‘task oriented’ layer that essentially executes tasks that have been passed to them by the creatives. This layer is composed of a maximum of thirteen individuals, of which some could be volunteer roles.

## Scaling through Layers <a href="#41c0" id="41c0"></a>

There are no limits to the available layers that can be created, though in this article we describe a six-layer social stack with a working group size of thirteen. This six-layer model can support an organizational size of 520–1040 individuals, with no need for central management. If an additional layer was added using a group size of twenty-one, this would result in an organizational capacity of 10,920–21,840 individuals respectively.

## **Why Layers?** <a href="#577a" id="577a"></a>

When you apply layers to a meritocratic structure, you get a very different picture than when you apply it to an autocratic structure. The difference is a model where those of higher merit have no power over the people they serve, for they truly are ‘public servants’. Leading is but an act of serving, and when we apply this model now into a social system, where merit gains you more responsibility, not authority; then we end up with a model that might just have a chance of showing us that the autocratic model is severely outdated, and that now, it’s time for an upgrade.
