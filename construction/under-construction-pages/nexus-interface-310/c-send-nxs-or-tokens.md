# C-Send NXS or Tokens

To send NXS or Tokens to another sigchain address, or to move between a sigchain's accounts, click on the _**`Send`**_ module icon located at the bottom of the overview page, and follow the below instructions:

### _**SEND FROM:**_

Select the account to send from using the drop down list which contains all available accounts. This includes NXS, trust and token accounts

### _**SEND TO**_:

Select one of your personal accounts using the drop down list, contacts saved in your address book, or copy and paste a new payee address. Tritium enables the use of the receivers username:account (case sensitive) like in the image below Zin:default (ZIN is the username and default is the account), this makes it easy for new users to transact and also avoids mistakes when copying the hex address.

### _**AMOUNT:**_

Enter the NXS or token quantity to send. This amount is in NXS.



## Advanced Options:

At the top of the "_`Send From"`_ field there is an **`Advanced Options`** toggle button. When the user enables this two more options are visible:&#x20;

### _**REFERENCE:**_&#x20;

Add an optional reference, order number or something which the user can refer to later from the transaction list.

### EXPIRES IN:

The user is provided an option to set an expiry option for the send transaction, the max time is seven days. The expiry provides four boxes which refer to days, hours, minutes and seconds which gives the user granular control of the expiry setting.

### Add Recipient

To send NXS or tokens to more than one recipient in a single transaction, find the **`+Add Recipient`** button below the reference field.

If the user has to send more than one transaction from the same "_`Send From`_" account, then click on the _**`Add Recipient`**_ button which adds another "_`Send To`_" field.

## Send Transaction

After the user has filled in all the required details and is ready to send the transaction, click on the "**`Proceed`**" button to send the transaction. This will open the pin confirmation box where the user enter's the pin, after which the transaction is sent to the network for processing.
