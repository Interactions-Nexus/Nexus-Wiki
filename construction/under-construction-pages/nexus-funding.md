# Nexus Funding

Nexus is self funded by two on-chain treasuries known as the Developer and Ambassador Keys.

### Developer Keys:

The Developer keys fuels the developer DAO to fund the ongoing development and is sourced by a 1.5% commission per block mined, which will slowly increase to 2.5% after 10 years. This brings all the benefits of development funding without the associated risks and limits the control which can exerted by the developer account.

### Ambassador Keys:&#x20;

The Ambassador (renamed from Exchange) keys are funded by a 20% commission per mined block reward. These keys are used to pay for the Ambassador DAO.
