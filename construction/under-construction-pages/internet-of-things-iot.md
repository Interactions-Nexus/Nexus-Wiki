# Internet of Things (IoT)

LxOS will allow computers to interact with the Nexus Protocol (NP) in a deeper manner than previously possible. The Lower Level Library (LLL) provides the basis for the entire NP, explaining how it arrived at the initial temporary name of LLL-OS. Nexus integrates verification into the NexOS by interweaving consensus throughout the user and kernel spaces. It leverages Signature Chains (SigChains) and the ledger to authenticate the file system, runtime memory and any change to the state of the kernel. Inheritance of the distributed database, ledger and protocols from Nexus constitute a form of distributed virtualization. Besides security properties, other desirable features emerge such as offline identity verification and roaming device synchronization.

Reading in detail about SigChains helps conceptualize the NexOS. But In short, SigChains serve as a built-in identity and access scheme. A SigChain represents an individual node, controls accounts, tokens, assets (Non-Fungible Tokens or NFTs), and access to several cryptographic tools enforcing the “authenticated” environment.

In general, enforcing distributed ledger compliance throughout the NexOS aids in discerning malicious code which “allows the kernel to know itself” - Colin Cantrell (9). IoT devices using NexOS leverage SigChains for device-level Identification and managing network connections. Location Identifier Separation Protocol(LISP) enables Nexus devices to engage with multiple virtual networks simultaneously, (IP/NP) while maintaining session, by separating identity from location. LISP represents a networking innovation that the Nexus team believes will play a crucial role in the internet's evolution.

Many IoT devices are being rushed to market with little consideration for security implications. Hasty designs and corners cut play a big part, but so far few standards have proven effective in this field. Even just the thought of being spied on by a [Nest thermostat](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2476599/black-hat-nest-thermostat-turned-into-a-smart-spy-in-15-seconds.html?ref=hackernoon.com) makes our temperature rise!

Using deterministic hardware identifications for device-level authentications (e.g. [International Mobile Equipment Identity - IMEI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International\_Mobile\_Equipment\_Identity?ref=hackernoon.com)) with a cryptographic identity based on SigChains, is an innovative security control mechanism for the IoT industry. The Nexus community aims to provide robust open standards to promote a stable transition into the IoT-dominated world. At first the NexOS will only target IoT use cases, but a consumer version for desktops, tablets and mobile will eventually follow.&#x20;

By binding devices to Nexus, a whole new class of potential applications emerges. Environmental, industrial, and consumer IoT use cases increasingly define life experience in the twenty-first century, and the NexOS positions the Nexus community for success in this rapidly changing world. Additionally, many potential [use cases](https://crypto.nexus.io/blockchain?ref=hackernoon.com) (below) supported by the Nexus blockchain are relevant to IoT and could be enhanced by incorporating NexOS as a core component.&#x20;
