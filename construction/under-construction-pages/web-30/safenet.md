# Safenet

Safenet is our vision of a truly decentralized internet and foundation of web3. Nexus is creating a truly decentralized economy. This vision  is clearly evident from the design of the software stack which interoperates with the Open Systems Interconnect(OSI) stack.

The grand vision for Nexus is to empower the community to build the Safenet - a fully decentralized internet owned and operated by people. Safenet will be powered by the Nexus blockchain, ONE stack, LX-OS, Decentralized internet infrastructure consisting of cube satellites, ground stations and ground based mesh networks.
