# SUPPLY

The Supply API provides functionality to support the ownership transfer requirements typical of a supply chain process. Items in the supply chain can be given a `data` value and this value can be updated over time. Items are stored in an APPEND register, meaning that changes to the item are recorded in sequence in the register. This in turn means that a history of changes to the `data` field, as well as the history of ownership of the item, can be obtained.

---
&nbsp;

## Named Shortcuts

For each API method we support an alternative endpoint that includes the item name or register address at the end of the the URL. This shortcut removes the need to include the item name or address as an additional parameter.

For example `supply/get/item/myitem` is a shortcut to `supply/get/item?name=myitem`.

Similarly `supply/get/item/5efc8a9437d93e894defd50f8ba73a0b2b5529cc593d5e4a7ea413022a9c35e9` is a shortcut to `supply/get/item?address=5efc8a9437d93e894defd50f8ba73a0b2b5529cc593d5e4a7ea413022a9c35e9`

The logic for resolving the shortcut to either a name or address is that if the data is 64 characters of hexadecimal then it will be assumed to be a register address. Otherwise it will be considered a name.

## Methods

The following methods are currently supported by this API

[`create/item`](#create/item)
[`get/item`](#get/item)
[`update/item`](#update/item)
[`transfer/item`](#transfer/item)
[`claim/item`](#claim/item)
[`list/item/history`](#list/item/history)

---
&nbsp;

## create/item <a href="#create/item" id="create/item"></a>

This will create a new item, assigning ownership to the user logged in to the provided session. The API supports an alternative endpoint that can include the new asset name in the URI. For example `supply/create/item/myitem` will resolve to `supply/create/item?name=myitem`.

#### Endpoint:

```
supply/create/item
```

### Code Snippets

#### Javascript:

```javascript
// create/item
const SERVER_URL = "http://api.nexus-interactions.io:8080"
let data = {
    pin: "YOUR_PIN",
    // session: "YOUR_SESSION_ID", //optional
    // name: "NAME TO IDENTIFY THE ITEM", //optional, If provided a Name object will also be created in the users local namespace, allowing the item to be accessed/retrieved by name. If no name is provided the item will need to be accessed/retrieved by its 256-bit register address.
    data: "DATA TO STORE IN THE ITEM"
}
fetch(`${SERVER_URL}/supply/create/item`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
    })
    .then(resp => resp.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json))
    .catch(error => console.log(error))
```

#### Python:

```python
import requests
SERVER_URL = "http://api.nexus-interactions.io:8080"
data = {
    "pin": "YOUR_PIN",
    # "session": "YOUR_SESSION_ID", #optional
    # "name": "NAME TO IDENTIFY THE ITEM", #optional, If provided a Name object will also be created in the users local namespace, allowing the item to be accessed/retrieved by name. If no name is provided the item will need to be accessed/retrieved by its 256-bit register address.
    "data": "DATA TO STORE IN THE ITEM"
}
response = requests.post(f"{SERVER_URL}/supply/create/item", json=data)
print(response.json())
```

### Parameters

`pin` : The PIN for this signature chain.

`session` : For multi-user API mode, (configured with multiuser=1) the session is required to identify which session (sig-chain) the asset should be created with. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`name` : An optional name to identify the item. If provided a Name object will also be created in the users local namespace, allowing the item to be accessed/retrieved by name. If no name is provided the item will need to be accessed/retrieved by its 256-bit register address.

`data` : The data to store in the item

> There is a limit of 1KB for Item data to be saved in the register, excluding the Item Name.
{.is-info}

#### Return value JSON object:

```json
{
    "address": "8FJxzexVDUN5YiQYK4QjvfRNrAUym8FNu4B8yvYGXgKFJL8nBse",
    "txid": "70e5d8b6227d209fafe4c90ed0ed7e63b23b72dc1349c60b37a00ed06e18215d5fa384da1b6522e24cb1467b11b0b0e8ac4e9db8374f09718ab1218e8da33a11"
}
```

#### Return values:

`txid` : The ID (hash) of the transaction that includes the item creation.

`address` : The register address for this item. The address (or name that hashes to this address) is needed for downstream transactions / api methods for this item.

&nbsp;

## get/item <a href="#get/item" id="get/item"></a>

This is the generic endpoint for retrieving an item from the object register. The Supply API supports an alternative endpoint that can include the item name (if known) in the URI. For example `/supply/get/item/myitem` will resolve to `supply/get/item?name=myitem`.

Additionally the API supports passing a field name in the URL after the asset name, which will populate the `fieldname` parameter in the request. For example `/supply/get/item/myitem/owner` will resolve to `supply/get/item?name=myitem&fieldname=owner`

#### Endpoint:

```
supply/get/item
```

### Code Snippets

#### Javascript:

```javascript
// get/item
const SERVER_URL = "http://api.nexus-interactions.io:8080"
let data = {
    name: "NAME IDENTIFYING THE ITEM", //optional if the address is provided. The name should be in the format username:name (for local names) or namespace::name (for names in a namespace). However, if the item was created in the callers namespace (their username), then the username can be omitted from the name if the session parameter is provided (as we can deduce the username from the session)
    // session: "YOUR_SESSION_ID", //optional
    // address: "REGISTER ADDRESS OF THE ITEM", //optional if the name is provided.
    // fieldname: "FILTER_FIELD", //optional field can be used to filter the response to return only a single field from the item.
}

        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
    })
    .then(resp => resp.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json))
    .catch(error => console.log(error))
```

response = requests.post(f"{SERVER_URL}/supply/transfer/item", json=data)
print(response.json())
```

### Parameters

`pin` : The PIN for this signature chain.

`session` : For multi-user API mode (configured with multiuser=1) the session is required to identify which session (sig-chain) owns the item. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`name` : The name identifying the item to be transferred. This is optional if the address is provided. The name should be in the format username:name (for local names) or namespace::name (for names in a namespace). However, if the item was created in the callers namespace (their username), then the username can be omitted from the name if the `session` parameter is provided (as we can deduce the username from the session)

`address` : The register address of the item to be transferred. This is optional if the name is provided.

`username` : The username identifying the user account (sig-chain) to transfer the item to. This is optional if the destination is provided.

`destination` : The genesis hash of the signature chain to transfer the the item to. This is optional if the username is provided.

`expires` : This optional field allows callers to specify an expiration for the transfer transaction. The expires value is the `number of seconds` from the transaction creation time after which the transaction can no longer be claimed by the recipient. Conversely, when you apply an expiration to a transaction, you are unable to void the transaction until after the expiration time. If expires is set to 0, the transaction will never expire, making the sender unable to ever void the transaction. If omitted, a default expiration of 7 days (604800 seconds) is applied.

#### Return value JSON object:

```json
{
    "txid": "27ef3f31499b6f55482088ba38b7ec7cb02bd4383645d3fd43745ef7fa3db3d1"
    "address": "8FJxzexVDUN5YiQYK4QjvfRNrAUym8FNu4B8yvYGXgKFJL8nBse"
}
```

#### Return values:

`txid` : The ID (hash) of the transaction that includes the item transfer.

`address` : The new register address for this item.

## claim/item <a href="#claim/item" id="claim/item"></a>

Items that have been transferred need to be claimed by the recipient before the transfer is complete. This method creates the claim transaction . This is a generic endpoint requiring the transcation ID (hash) of the corresponding transfer transaction to be passed as a parameter. The API supports an alternative endpoint that can include the transaction ID in the URI. For example `/supply/transfer/item/27ef3f31499b6f55482088ba38b7ec7cb02bd4383645d3fd43745ef7fa3db3d1` will resolve to `supply/transfer/item?txid=27ef3f31499b6f55482088ba38b7ec7cb02bd4383645d3fd43745ef7fa3db3d1`.

#### Endpoint:
