# FINANCE

The Finance API provides methods for sending and receiving NXS coins or other tokens between users / accounts, creating accounts, and managing staking.

&nbsp;

## Named Shortcuts

For each API method we support an alternative endpoint that includes the account name or register address at the end of the the URL. This shortcut removes the need to include the account name or address as an additional parameter.

For example `finance/create/account/savings` is a shortcut to `finance/create/account?name=savings`.

Similarly `finance/get/account/5efc8a9437d93e894defd50f8ba73a0b2b5529cc593d5e4a7ea413022a9c35e9` is a shortcut to `finance/get/account?address=5efc8a9437d93e894defd50f8ba73a0b2b5529cc593d5e4a7ea413022a9c35e9`

The logic for resolving the shortcut to either a name or address is that if the data is 64 characters of hexadecimal then it will be assumed to be a register address. Otherwise it will be considered a name.

&nbsp;

## create/account

Create a new account for receiving NXS. The API supports an alternative endpoint that can include the account name in the URL. For example `/finance/create/account/savings` will resolve to `finance/create/account?name=savings`.

#### Endpoint:

```
finance/create/account
```

### Parameters

`pin` : The PIN for this signature chain.

`session` : For multi-user API mode, (configured with multiuser=1) the session is required to identify which session (sig-chain) the account should be created with. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`token_name` : Optional name of a token to create the account for. `token` can be supplied as an alternative to `token_name`. Defaults to `NXS`.

`token` : Optional token address to create the account for. `token_name` can be supplied as an alternative to `token`. Defaults to `0` (`NXS`)

`name` : An optional name to identify the account. If provided a Name object will also be created in the users local namespace, allowing the account to be accessed/retrieved by name. If no name is provided the account will need to be accessed/retrieved by its 256-bit register address.

`data` : This optional field allows callers to add arbitrary data to an account register.

#### Example:

This example creates a NXS account called "main".

```json
{
    "pin": "1234",
    "name": "main"
}
```

### Code Snippets

#### Javascript:

```javascript
// create/account
const SERVER_URL = "http://api.nexus-interactions.io:8080"
let data = {
    pin: "YOUR_PIN",
    // session: "YOUR_SESSION_ID", //optional
    token_name: "NXS", // optional if token is passed
    // token: "TOKEN ADDRESS TO CREATE THE ACCOUNT FOR",//optional if token_name is passed, Defaults to 0 (NXS)
    // name: "NAME TO IDENTIFY THE ACCOUNT", //optional
    // data: "OPTIONAL FIELD ALLOWS CALLERS TO ADD ARBITRARY DATA TO AN ACCOUNT REGISTER.",//optional
}
fetch(`${SERVER_URL}/finance/create/account`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
    })
    .then(resp => resp.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json))
    .catch(error => console.log(error))
```

#### Python:

```python
import requests
SERVER_URL = "http://api.nexus-interactions.io:8080"
data = {
    "pin": "YOUR_PIN",
    # "session": "YOUR_SESSION_ID", #optional
    "token_name": "NXS",  # optional if token is passed
    # "token": "TOKEN ADDRESS TO CREATE THE ACCOUNT FOR",#optional if token_name is passed, Defaults to 0 (NXS)
    # "name": "NAME TO IDENTIFY THE ACCOUNT", #optional
    # "data": "OPTIONAL FIELD ALLOWS CALLERS TO ADD ARBITRARY DATA TO AN ACCOUNT REGISTER.",#optional
}
response = requests.post(f"{SERVER_URL}/finance/create/account", json=data)
print(response.json())
```


#### Return value JSON object:

```json
{
    "txid": "f9dcd28bce2563ab288fab76cf3ee5149ea938c735894ce4833b55e474e08e8a519e8005e09e2fc19623577a8839a280ca72b6430ee0bdf13b3d9f785bc7397d",
    "address": "8CvLySLAWEKDB9SJSUDdRgzAG6ALVcXLzPQREN9Nbf7AzuJkg5P"
}
```

#### Return values:

`txid` : The ID (hash) of the transaction that includes the account creation.

`address` : The register address for this account. The address (or name that hashes to this address) is needed when creating crediting or debiting the account.

---
&nbsp;

## debit/account

Deduct an amount of NXS from an account and send it to another account or legacy UTXO address. The API supports an alternative endpoint that can include the account name in the URL. For example `/finance/debit/account/savings` will resolve to `finance/debit/account?name=savings`.

Any fee that is applicable fo this transaction is deducted from the sending account, NOT the default account.

The method supports the ability to send to multiple recipients in one transaction by supplying a `recipients` array instead of the single `name_to`/`address_to`/`amount`. The method allows up to 99 recipients to be supplied.

#### Endpoint:

```
finance/debit/account
```

### Parameters

`pin` : The PIN for this signature chain.

`session` : For multi-user API mode, (configured with multiuser=1) the session is required to identify which session (sig-chain) the account owner. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`name` : The name identifying the account to debit. This is optional if the address is provided. The name should be in the format username:name (for local names) or namespace::name (for names in a namespace). However, if the account was created in the callers namespace (their username), then the username can be omitted from the name if the `session` parameter is provided (as we can deduce the username from the session)

`address` : The register address of the account to debit. This is optional if the name is provided.

`amount` : The amount of NXS to debit.

`name_to` : The name identifying the account to send to. This is optional if address\_to is provided. The name should be in username:name format

`address_to` : The register address of the account to send to. This is optional if name\_to is provided. The address\_to can also contain a legacy UTXO address if sending from a signature chain account to a legacy address.

`reference` : This optional field allows callers to provide a reference, which the recipient can then use to relate the transaction to an order number, invoice number etc. The reference is be a `64-bit unsigned integer` in the range of 0 to 18446744073709551615

`expires` : This optional field allows callers to specify an expiration for the debit transaction. The expires value is the `number of seconds` from the transaction creation time after which the transaction can no longer be credited by the recipient. Conversely, when you apply an expiration to a transaction, you are unable to void the transaction until after the expiration time. If expires is set to 0, the transaction will never expire, making the sender unable to ever void the transaction. If omitted, a default expiration of 7 days (604800 seconds) is applied.

`recipients` : This optional array can be provided as an alternative to the single `name_to`/`address_to`, `amount`, `reference`, and `expires` fields. Each object in the array can have `name_to`/`address_to`, `amount`, `reference`, and `expires` fields, as described above. Up to 99 recipients can be included in the array.

#### Example:

The following example shows the json payload for a debit of 10.5 NXS from an account called "main" (that itself was created by the sig chain logged into session "5e9d8aa625a1838f60f30e12058089169e32c968389f365428f7b0c878bb47f8") being sent to an account identified by the name "bob:savings". In the name\_to field, "bob" refers to the username of the account holder and "savings" is their NXS account. If Bob is concerned about privacy he could have provided the register address of his token account instead

```json
{
    "pin": "1234",
    "session": "5e9d8aa625a1838f60f30e12058089169e32c968389f365428f7b0c878bb47f8",
    "name": "main",
    "amount": 10.5,
    "name_to": "bob:savings"
}{
    "pin": "1234",
    "session": "5e9d8aa625a1838f60f30e12058089169e32c968389f365428f7b0c878bb47f8",
    "name": "main",
    "amount": 10.5,
    "name_to": "bob:savings"
}
```

#### Example Multiple Recipients:

The following example shows the json payload for a debit from an account called "default" made to 3 separate recipients, each receiving 5 NXS, and each with a different reference

```json
{
    "pin": "1234",
    "name": "default"
    "recipients" :
    [
        {
            "name_to": "bob:savings",
            "amount": 5,
            "reference": 1234
        },
        {
            "address_to": "8CHjS5Qe7Mghgrqb6NeEaVxjexbdp9p2QVdRTt8W4rzbWhu3fL8",
            "amount": 5,
            "reference": 5678
        },
        {
            "address_to": "4kYv4Xft6wufMVi191nQDNprgkK6kzy6gqWRpmfMxyx9KMfEV1u",
            "amount": 5
        }
    ]
}
```

## credit/account

Increment an amount received from another NXS account to an account owned by your signature chain. The API supports an alternative endpoint that can include the account name to credit in the URL. For example `/finance/credit/account/savings` will resolve to `finance/credit/account?name=savings`.

#### Endpoint:

```
finance/credit/account
```

### Parameters

`pin` : The PIN for this signature chain.

`session` : For multi-user API mode, (configured with multiuser=1) the session is required to identify which session (sig-chain) owns the account. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`txid` : The transaction ID (hash) of the corresponding debit transaction for which you are creating this credit for. The transaction can also be a legacy transaction created from sendtoaddress or sendmany where the inputs are UTXO but the output is an account register address.

`name` : The name identifying the account to credit. This is only required when crediting a split payment transaction (where the receiving account is not included in the credit transaction) and is optional if the address is provided. The name should be in the format username:name (for local names) or namespace::name (for names in a namespace). However, if the account was created in the callers namespace (their username), then the username can be omitted from the name if the `session` parameter is provided (as we can deduce the username from the session)

`address` : The register address of the account to credit. This is only required when crediting a split payment transaction (where the receiving account is not included in the credit transaction) and is optional if the name is provided.

`name_proof` : The name identifying the account that proves your ownership of the share of the debit. This is only required for split payments and is optional if the address is provided. The name should be in the format username:name (for local names) or namespace::name (for names in a namespace). However, if the account was created in the callers namespace (their username), then the username can be omitted from the name if the `session` parameter is provided (as we can deduce the username from the session)

`address_proof` : The register address of the account that proves your ownership of the share of the debit. This is only required for spit payments and is optional if the name is provided.

#### Example:

The following example shows the json payload for a credit to an account called "savings" (that itself was created by the sig chain logged into session "5e9d8aa625a1838f60f30e12058089169e32c968389f365428f7b0c878bb47f8") identified by the name "bob:savings". In the name field, "bob" refers to the username of the account holder and "savings" is their NXS account.

```json
{
    "pin": "1234",
    "session": "5e9d8aa625a1838f60f30e12058089169e32c968389f365428f7b0c878bb47f8",
    "name": "bob:savings",
    "txid": "f9dcd28bce2563ab288fab76cf3ee5149ea938c735894ce4833b55e474e08e8a519e8005e09e2fc19623577a8839a280ca72b6430ee0bdf13b3d9f785bc7397d"

```

#### Return values:

`txid` : The ID (hash) of the transaction that includes the credit.

## get/account

Retrieves information about a NXS account . The API supports an alternative endpoint that can include the account name in the URL. For example `/finance/get/account/savings` will resolve to `finance/get/account?name=savings`.

Additionally the API supports passing a field name in the URL after the account name, which will populate the `fieldname` parameter in the request and filter the response on that field. For example `/finance/get/account/savings/balance` will resolve to `finance/get/account?name=savings&fieldname=balance`

#### Endpoint:

```
finance/get/account
```

### Parameters

`name` : The name identifying the NXS account to retrieve. This is optional if the address is provided. The name should be in the format username:name (for local names) or namespace::name (for names in a namespace). However, if the object was created in the callers namespace (their username), then the username can be omitted from the name if the `session` parameter is provided (as we can deduce the username from the session)

`session` : For multi-user API mode, (configured with multiuser=1) the session can be provided in conjunction with the name in order to deduce the register address of the object. The `session` parameter is only required when a name parameter is also provided without a namespace in the name string. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`address` : The register address of the NXS account to retrieve. This is optional if the name is provided.

`count` : Optional boolean field that determines whether the response includes the transaction `count` field. This defaults to false, as including the transaction count can slow the response time of the method considerably.

`fieldname`: This optional field can be used to filter the response to return only a single field from the account.

### Code Snippets

#### Javascript:

```javascript
// get/account
const SERVER_URL = "http://api.nexus-interactions.io:8080"
let data = {
    name: "username:name", //name identifying the nxs account to retrieve. optional if the address is provided.
    // session: "YOUR_SESSION_ID", //optional
    // address : "REGISTER ADDRESS OF THE NXS ACCOUNT TO RETRIEVE", //optional if the name is provided.
    // count : true, //optional boolean field that determines whether the response includes the transaction count field. slower to calculate
    // fieldname: "FILTERING FIELD NAME", //optional
}
fetch(`${SERVER_URL}/finance/get/account`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
    })
    .then(resp => resp.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json))
    .catch(error => console.log(error))
```

#### Python:

```python
import requests
SERVER_URL = "http://api.nexus-interactions.io:8080"
data = {
    "name": "username:name", # name identifying the nxs account to retrieve. optional if the address is provided.
    # "session": "YOUR_SESSION_ID", #optional
    # "address" : "REGISTER ADDRESS OF THE NXS ACCOUNT TO RETRIEVE", #optional if the name is provided.

    # "fieldname": "FILTERING FIELD NAME", #optional
}
response = requests.post(f"{SERVER_URL}/finance/get/account", json=data)
print(response.json())
```


#### Return value JSON object:

```json
{
    "owner": "a2e51edcd41a8152bfedb24e3c22ee5a65d6d7d524146b399145bced269aeff0",
    "created": 1566534164,
    "modified": 1566616211,
    "name": "default",
    "address": "8CbkwEQ9S8owmX74joU6XmiwxJq1aoiqUoXc9fLCKzw15HscM99",
    "token_name": "NXS",
    "token": "0",
    "data": "abcd1234",
    "balance": 2903.239792,
    "pending": 0.0,
    "unconfirmed": 76.492244
}
```

#### Return values:

`owner` : The genesis hash of the signature chain that owns this account.

`created` : The UNIX timestamp when the account was created.

`modified` : The UNIX timestamp when the account was last modified.

`name` : The name identifying the account. For privacy purposes, this is only included in the response if the caller is the owner of the account

`address` : The register address of the account.

`token` : This will always be set to 0 for NXS accounts.

`data` : The arbitrary data included in the account register. If no data was included during the account creation then this field will be omitted.

`balance` : The available balance of this account. This is the last confirmed balance less any new debits that you have made since the last block

`pending` : This is the sum of all confirmed debit transactions that have been made to this account, that have not yet been credited. To move coins from pending into the available balance you must create a corresponding credit transaction. NOTE: if configured to run, the events processor does this for you.

`unconfirmed` : This is the sum of all unconfirmed debit transactions that have been made to this account PLUS the sum of all unconfirmed credits that you have for confirmed debit transactions. When someone makes a debit to your account it will immediately appear in the unconfirmed balance until that transaction is included in a block, at which point it moves into `pending`. When you (or the events processor) creates the corresponding credit transaction for that debit, the amount will move from `pending` back into `unconfirmed` until the credit transaction is included in a block, at which point the amount moves to `balance`.

`stake` : Only returned for the trust account, this is the amount of NXS currently staked in the trust account.

`count` : Only returned if the caller requested `count` : true. This is the number of transactions made to/from the account.

---
&nbsp;

## list/accounts

This will list off all of the NXS accounts belonging to the currently logged in signature chain.

#### Endpoint:

```
finance/list/accounts
```

### Parameters

`session` : For multi-user API mode, (configured with multiuser=1) the session is required to identify which session (sig-chain) owns the account. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`count` : Optional boolean field that determines whether the response includes the transaction `count` field. This defaults to false, as including the transaction count can slow the response time of the method considerably.

`limit` : The number of records to return for the current page. The default is 100.

`page` : Allows the results to be returned by page (zero based). E.g. passing in page=1 will return the second set of (limit) records. The default value is 0 if not supplied.

`offset` : An alternative to `page`, offset can be used to return a set of (limit) results from a particular index.

`where` : An array of clauses to filter the JSON results. More information on filtering the results from /list/xxx API methods can be found here Filtering Results.

        "pending": 0.0,
        "unconfirmed": 0.0
    }
]
```

#### Return values:

`created` : The UNIX timestamp when the account was created.

`modified` : The UNIX timestamp when the account was last modified.

`name` : The name identifying the account. For privacy purposes, this is only included in the response if the caller is the owner of the account

`address` : The register address of the account.

`token_name` : This will always be set to `NXS`.

`token` : This will always be set to 0 for NXS accounts.

`data` : The arbitrary data included in the account register. If no data was included during the account creation then this field will be omitted.

`balance` : The available balance of this account. This is the last confirmed balance less any new debits that you have made since the last block

`pending` : This is the sum of all confirmed debit transactions that have been made to this account, that have not yet been credited. To move coins from pending into the available balance you must create a corresponding credit transaction. NOTE: if configured to run, the events processor does this for you.

`unconfirmed` : This is the sum of all unconfirmed debit transactions that have been made to this account PLUS the sum of all unconfirmed credits that you have for confirmed debit transactions. When someone makes a debit to your account it will immediately appear in the unconfirmed balance until that transaction is included in a block, at which point it moves into `pending`. When you (or the events processor) creates the corresponding credit transaction for that debit, the amount will move from `pending` back into `unconfirmed` until the credit transaction is included in a block, at which point the amount moves to `balance`.

`stake` : Only returned for the trust account, this is the amount of NXS currently staked in the trust account.

`count` : Only returned if the caller requested `count` : true. This is the number of transactions made to/from the account.

&nbsp;

## list/account/transactions

This will list off all of the transactions related to a given account. You DO NOT need to be logged in to use this command. If you are logged in, then neither username or genesis are required as it will default to the logged in user.


> **NOTE** : The returned transaction data will only include contracts that related to the requested account. Any other contracts are omitted from the transaction result.
{.is-info}


> **NOTE** : If you use the username parameter it will take slightly longer to calculate the username genesis with our brute-force protected hashing algorithm. For higher performance, use the genesis parameter.
{.is-info}


#### Endpoint:

```
finance/list/account/transactions
```

### Parameters

`genesis` : The genesis hash identifying the signature chain to scan for transactions (optional if username is supplied or already logged in).

`username` : The username identifying the signature chain to scan for transactions(optional if genesis is supplied or already logged in).

`session` : For multi-user API mode, (configured with multiuser=1) the session can be provided in conjunction with the account name in order to deduce the register address of the account. The `session` parameter is only required when a name parameter is also provided without a namespace in the name string. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`name` : The name identifying the NXS account to list transactions for. This is optional if the address is provided. The name should be in the format username:name (for local names) or namespace::name (for names in a namespace). However, if the object was created in the callers namespace (their username), then the username can be omitted from the name if the `session` parameter is provided (as we can deduce the username from the session)

`address` : The register address of the NXS account to list transactions for. This is optional if the name is provided.

`verbose` : Optional, determines how much transaction data to include in the response. Supported values are :

* `default` : hash, contracts
* `summary` : type, version, sequence, timestamp, operation, and confirmations.
* `detail` : genesis, nexthash, prevhash, pubkey and signature.

`limit` : The number of records to return for the current page. The default is 100.

`page` : Allows the results to be returned by page (zero based). E.g. passing in page=1 will return the second set of (limit) records. The default value is 0 if not supplied.

`offset` : An alternative to `page`, offset can be used to return a set of (limit) results from a particular index.

`where` : An array of clauses to filter the JSON results. More information on filtering the results from /list/xxx API methods can be found here Filtering Results.

`amount` : Amount of stake change. Positive will be added to stake (moved from balance) and negative will unstake (move to balance).

`requested` : Timestamp when the stake change request was created.

`expires`: Timestamp when the stake change request expires, if assigned. Zero indicates does not expire.

---
&nbsp;

## set/stake

Creates a stake change request for a signature chain's trust account. This request will add or remove stake to set the stake value to the requested amount. If the new value is more than the current stake amount, it adds stake from the account balance. If the new value is less, it removes stake to the account balance (with appropriate trust penalty, if applicable).

Requests are saved locally and take effect with the next stake block found by staking the signature chain's trust account. Because they are saved locally, you must continue to stake on the machine where it was created until the next stake block is found, or the request will not be processed.

Until implemented, you can update the request by calling set/stake again.

To remove a stake change request, you can either set an expiration time, or set the amount equal to the current trust account stake.

#### Endpoint:

```
finance/set/stake
```

### Parameters

`pin` : The PIN for the signature chain.

`session` : For multi-user API mode, (configured with multiuser=1) the session is required to identify which session (sig-chain) owns the trust account. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`amount` : The new amount of NXS to stake.

`expires` : Optional field to assign the number of seconds until the stake change request expires. A value of zero indicates it does not expire. Default is zero if not passed.

## migrate/accounts


> Depreciated
{.is-warning}


This method will migrate your legacy accounts to signature chain accounts, sending the balance across in the process. A new account will be created in your signature chain for each legacy account, with a corresponding matching name (unless flagged not to create names). The balance of each legacy account is sent to the newly created signature chain account in individual transactions. As such, each transaction incurs the default legacy fee of 0.01 NXS, which is deducted from the amount being migrated.

The method uses the arbitrary `data` field in the account object register to track which legacy account it was created from. As a result, it is possible to invoke this method multiple times, and each time it will sweep any NXS from legacy accounts to existing signature chain accounts (as well as creating any necessary new accounts).

#### Endpoint:

```
finance/migrate/accounts
```

### Parameters

`pin` : The PIN for the signature chain.

`session` : For multi-user API mode, (configured with multiuser=1) the session is required to identify which session (sig-chain) owns the trust account. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`walletpassphrase` : Optional field to provide the wallet passphrase. This value is required if the wallet is not currently unlocked.

`createname` : Optional boolean field indicating whether to create a Name record for the newly created signature chain accounts. If omitted, the default behaviour is to create a Name record, which incurs a fee of 1 NXS per account.


#### Return value JSON object:

```json
[
    {
        "account": "default",
        "address": "8BzPhYgcHAP26CYnCvHTQmPiBH7FBC2PAB4rR9YgWxcK7L4c46X",

    }
]
```

#### Return values:

`account` : The legacy account name (and tritium account name, unless `createname=false` was explicitly set in the request)

`address` : The register address of the signature chain account that the legacy funds have been migrated to.

`amount` : The NXS amount transferred from the legacy account to the signature chain account.

`txid` : If the the legacy send was successful, the ID (hash) of the legacy transaction.

`error` : If the legacy send failed, this field includes the legacy send error message.

## list/balances

This will retrieve a summary of balance information across all accounts for each coin/token type owned, belonging to the currently logged in signature chain.

#### Endpoint:

```
finance/list/balances
```


### Parameters

`session` : For multi-user API mode, (configured with multiuser=1) the session is required to identify which session (sig-chain) to return data for. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`limit` : The number of records to return for the current page. The default is 100.

`page` : Allows the results to be returned by page (zero based). E.g. passing in page=1 will return the second set of (limit) records. The default value is 0 if not supplied.

`offset` : An alternative to `page`, offset can be used to return a set of (limit) results from a particular index.

`where` : An array of clauses to filter the JSON results. More information on filtering the results from /list/xxx API methods can be found here Filtering Results.
