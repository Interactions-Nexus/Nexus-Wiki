# Create a Namespace

This guide will help users to create a **Namespace** using the Nexus Interface. Before we start to create a **Namespace**, users need to be familiar with the concept and usage.

### NAMESPACE:

Namespaces allow users to provide user-friendly names for their object registers without needing to disclose their username. This is useful for privacy, but also to allow names to be related to a business or some other meaningful context.&#x20;

To avoid name-squatting registering a namespace attracts a fee 1000 NXS. However once registered, creating `Names` within a namespace costs only 1 NXS.


> **NOTE:** Creating a Namespace will incur a fee of 1000 NXS

## Uses of Namespace

Namespaces can be used for a few things:

* It can be used as a company name, a layer above the user account. All the transactions can be sent to namespace::account.
* It can provide privacy by hiding the username for the Sigchain
* In the future it can be used as Domain Name for websites hosted on Nexus Cloud

## Namespace Parameters

### Name

This is the name, the user wants to be registered as namespace.&#x20;


> **NOTE** : Namespaces can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and period (**.**).

## Create a Namespace

To create a Namespace using the Interface follow the steps:

* Open the Nexus Interface, make sure the wallet is fully synched and log into the user account (Sigchain).
* In the Overview page, at the bottom click on the "_User"_ module. This opens the User page.
* In the User page, on the left side click on the "Name_space_" tab.
* In the Namespace page click on "_Create a new namespace_". This opens the _Create a new namespace_ page.&#x20;
* In this page the user has to provide the "Name parameter which will be the namespace .&#x20;
* Once the name is provided, click on the "CREATE NAMESPACE" button on the bottom of the page.
* Once the namespace is registered on the blockchain, it will be listed under the "Namespace" page.



> The fee of 1000 NXS will be deducted from the "default" account. Make sure the account has required NXS to cover the transaction.
