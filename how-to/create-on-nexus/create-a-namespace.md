# Create a Namespace

This guide will help users to create a **Namespace** using the Nexus Interface. Before we start to create a **Namespace**, users need to be familiar with the concept and usage.

### NAMESPACE:

Namespaces allow users to provide user-friendly names for their object registers without needing to disclose their username. This is useful for privacy, but also to allow names to be related to a business or some other meaningful context.&#x20;

To avoid name-squatting registering a namespace attracts a high fee (`1000 NXS`). However once registered, creating Names within that namespace costs only `1 NXS`

{% hint style="info" %}
`Creating a Namespace will incur a fee of 1000 NXS`
{% endhint %}

## `Uses of Namespace`

`Namespaces can be used for a few things:`

* `It can be used as a company name, a layer above the user account. All the transactions can be done by sending the transactions to namespace::account.`
* `It can provide privacy by hiding the username for the Sigchain`
* `In the future it can be used as Domain Name for websites hosted on Nexus Cloud`

## Namespace Parameters

### Name

This is the name, the user wants to be registered as namespace.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE** : Namespaces can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and periods **** (**.**).
{% endhint %}

## Create a Namespace

To create a Namespace using the Interface follow the steps:

* Open the Nexus Interface, make sure the wallet is fully synched and log into the user account (Sigchain).
* In the Overview page, at the bottom click on the "_User"_ module. This opens the User page.
* In the User page, on the left side click on the "Name_space_" tab.
* In the Namespace page click on "_Create a new namespace_". This opens the _Create a new namespace_ page.&#x20;
* In this page the user has to provide the "Name parameter which will be the namespace .&#x20;
* Once the name is provided, click on the "CREATE NAMESPACE" button on the bottom of the page.

{% hint style="info" %}
The fee of 1000 NXS will be deducted from the "default" account. Make sure the account  has NXS to cover the transaction.
{% endhint %}

* Once the namespace is registered on the blockchain, it will be listed in the "Namespace" page
