<h3 class="toc-header" id="what-is-asset-tokenization"> What is Asset Tokenization</h3>
<p><code>Asset Tokenization</code> also referred as  <code>Asset Backed Tokens</code> or <code>Tokenized Assets</code> is a new concept that uses digital tokens to fractionalize ownership of assets such as property, jewellery or fine art and uses contracts on blockchain to manage these ownership rights</p>
<p>This guide will help users to  create a <em><strong>Tokenized Asset</strong></em> using the Nexus Interface.</p>
<p>Before we start to create an asset tokenization, users need to be familiar with some of the concepts and parameters used.</p>
<p>To tokenize an asset, user needs to create the asset and token as per the guides linked below.</p>

<h2 class="toc-header" id="asset-payout"> Asset Payout</h2>
<p>The main utility of tokenized assets is to enable fractional ownership and to share the revenue with the token holders. To send the payout to the token holders the user sends NXS equivalent in value to the revenue generated, to the asset address and it will be automatically be distributed as per the percentage token holdings of each holder.</p>
<p>{% hint style="warning" %}<br>
The payout is distributed taking the maxsupply as 100% of the tokens. If any tokens are still in the token generation address, the percentage of payout corresponding to the balance tokens will be returned to the sender.</p>
