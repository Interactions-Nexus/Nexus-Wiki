# Create Names

This guide will help users to create a **Names** using the Nexus Interface. Before we start to create a **Names** also known as **Local Names**, users need to be familiar with the concepts and usage.

### NAMES

Names are those created within the context of a signature chain and are also known as local names. To use a local name you must prefix the name with the owners username separated by a single colon, e.g. `bob:savings`. This is equivalent to saying "look at all the Names registered in the sig chain `bob` and find one called `savings` and then see what object register it points to". There can only be one Name called `savings` in the sig chain `bob`, but another user  `alice` can also create a local name called `savings`

{% hint style="info" %}
`Names are local or reside within the context of a Sigchain.`
{% endhint %}

#### Register Address
