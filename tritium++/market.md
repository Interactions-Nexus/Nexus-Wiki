# MARKET
The Market API is an on-chain, order book based P2P marketplace for trading tokens and assets. Assets can include both digital and physical goods. Users start by creating a new market with a token pair (NXS/XYZ) and other users can participate in that particular market, execute a particular order or cancel a placed order.

## How market prices Are quoted

Each market pair represents the current exchange rate for the two tokens. Here’s how to interpret that information, using market=NXS/XYZ—or the Nexus-to-XYZ exchange rate—as an example:

> The current price is the last traded price and has nothing to do with the bid or ask price.
{.is-info}


* The token on the left (NXS) is the base token.
* The token on the right (XYZ) is the quote token.
* The price quoted represents how much of the quote token is needed to buy 1 unit of the base token. As a result, the base token is always expressed as 1 unit while the quote currency varies based on the current market and how much is needed to buy 1 unit of the base currency.
* If the NXS/XYZ exchange rate is 1.2, that means 1 NXS will buy 1.20 XYZ (or, put another way, it will cost 1.20 XYZ to buy 1 NXS).
* When the market rate rises, that means the base token has risen in value relative to the quote token (because 1 NXS will buy more XYZ tokens) and conversely, if the market rate falls, that means the base token has fallen in value.


> **Note:** Market pairs are usually presented with the base token first and the quote token second, The market API allows to use the reverse market=XYZ/NXS and its treated as bid/ask depending on the noun.

## create <a href="#create" id="create"></a>

This method creates a new market pair or becomes part of an existing market represented by the token or asset pair token1/token2. Market pair token2/token1 is also part of the same market.

```
market/create/noun
```

This command supports the `bid and` `ask` nouns.

##### create/bid

This creates a bid market order for market=token1/token2, ask for market=token2/token1

##### create/ask

To creates a ask market order for market=token1/token2, bid for market=token2/token1

> When market=token1/token2 is reversed to market=token2/token1 the price has to be changed accordingly. The market pair is determined by the first order which creates the market.
{.is-info}


### Parameters:

`pin` : Required if **locked**. The `PIN` to authorize the transaction.

`session` : Required by **argument** `-multiuser=1` to be supplied to identify the session. For single-user API mode the `session` should not be supplied.&#x20;

`market` : token1/token2 - The token pair for which the order is created.

`amount` : The amount of token2 to be exchanged.

`price` : The price of the token2 in relation to token1.

`to` : This is the receiving account name or register address to credit token1.

`from` : This is the sending account name or register address to debit the token2.
