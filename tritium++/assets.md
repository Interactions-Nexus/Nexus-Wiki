# ASSETS

An asset is a user-defined data structure that is stored in an object register, owned by a profile. Assets can hold one or more pieces of data and users can define the fields (name, data, type, mutability) that data is stored in. The Assets API supports the `readonly`, `raw`, `basic` and `JSON` formats and the user is required to specify the format.

The `readonly` and `raw` formats are useful when developers wish to store arbitrary data, without incurring the overhead of defining an object. The value will be provided with the `data` parameter. The `readonly` format cannot be updated and is stored in a readonly register. The `raw` format is stored in a raw register and allows the data to be updated.

The `basic` format allows callers to define an asset in terms of simple 'key=value' pairs. It assumes all values are stored using the string data type. The 'key=value' pairs can be updated.

The `JSON` format allows callers to provide a detailed definition of the supply data structure, with each field defined with a specific data type and mutability. Items defined with one of the complex formats can be updated after their initial creation.

The assets API also provides a history of changes to the values, as well as the history of ownership of the item.

The full supported endpoint of the finance URI is as follows:

```
assets/verb/noun/filter/operator
```

The minimum required components of the URI are:

```
assets/verb/noun
```

## Direct Endpoints

The following commands are direct endpoints and thus do not support the above `verb` and `noun` structure available above.

[`list/partial`](#list/partial) - List users partial ownership details for tokenized assets.

---
&nbsp;

## create <a href="#create" id="create"></a>

Create a new object register specified by given noun.

```
assets/create/noun
```

This command supports the `asset`, `readonly`, `raw`, and `any` nouns.

**create/asset**

Creates a new asset in an object register.

**create/readonly**

Creates a new asset in an readonly register.

**create/raw**

Creates a new asset in a raw register.

**create/any**

Creates a new asset specified by the format parameter.

### Parameters:

`pin` : Required if **locked**. The `PIN` for this profile.

`session` : Required by **argument** `-multiuser=1` to be supplied to identify the user session. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`name` : Optional for **noun** `name` as a _UTF-8_ encoded string that will generate a name object register that points to new object.

`format` : Required to **identify** the format used to define the asset. Values can be `readonly`, `raw`, `basic` and `JSON`.

`data` : Required if **format** is `readonly` or `raw`, allows caller to add arbitrary data to object. `readonly` assets cannot be updated All other preceding fields are ignored.

`<fieldname>=<value>` : Optional for **format** `basic`, The caller can provide 'key=value' pairs for each piece of data to store in the asset.

`json` : If **format** is `JSON`, then this field will hold the json definition of the asset as a JSON array of objects representing each field in the object. It uses the following format:

* `name` : The name of the data field.
* `type` : The data type to use for this field. Values can be uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uint256, uint512, uint1024, string, or bytes.
* `value` : The default value of the field.
* `mutable` : The boolean field to indicate whether the field is writable (true) or read-only (false).
* `maxlength`: Only applicable to string or bytes fields where mutable=true, this is the maximum number of characters (bytes) that can be stored in the field. If no maxlength parameter is provided then we will default the field size to the length of the default value rounded up to the nearest 64 bytes.


> **NOTE:**
> There is a limit of 1KB for asset data to be saved in the register, excluding the asset name.
> There is a fee of 1 NXS for creating and an asset and an additional 1 NXS for the optional name object.
