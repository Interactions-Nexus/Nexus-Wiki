# INCIDENT REPORT

The arm will check and balance itself and the responsibility lies with every team member working in the arm. Every person in the arm has to be fully aware of the DAO constituition, arm processes and the contract. It is manadated that when any of the DAO or arm processes is broken it has to be submitted as incident report to the chair. The incident reporting should not be used as a weapon to haress other member(s) or group(s) and the arm has to make sure of this.

The incident reports will be of two types:

- **Internal Incidents** - This incident report is internal to the arm and investigation will be carried out at the creative layer.

- **External Incidents** - This incident report is external to the arm and investigation will be carried out by the Judiciary.

## Internal Incident Reports:

The arm internal incident reports again will be of two types:

- **Normal Incidents**

- **Critical Incidents**

## External Incident Reports:

The external incident reports are filed against other arms or persons in other arms. This is not under the purvue of the arm internal process and will be investigated by the Judiciary.
 

## Normal Incidents
The following violations but not limited to will be filed under normal internal reports:
- Non-performance or failure to carry out assigned jobs without valid reason.

- Unauthorized leave of absence.

- Failure to confirm to the arm internal processes as outlined.

## Critical Incidents
The following violations but not limited to will be filed under critical internal reports. These might even be later referred to the judicairy for investigation.

-	Violating the rules laid out by the DAO constitution. This will be applicable to any additions or deletions in the future.

-	Violating the rules laid out in the arm internal process document.

-	Violating the arm and group isolation policies.

- Trying to take over the arm, by any means.

- Creating a common group for Ambassadors and joining any such common (closed or private) groups is prohibited.

-	Working with any people, groups, projects or being part of channels which want to hurt Nexus in any way.

-	Sharing sensitive information to profit self or any other third party.

-	Conflict of Interest which is not notified to the facilitator or chair in advance. 


-	Voting every quarter is conducted in a free and fair at the working and creative groups.

-	Members of the working group ensure that facilitators are doing their job and facilitators ensure the Chair is doing the job. (This has to be judged on a quarterly basis and not on a day to day basis) 

-	Invoices paid out in time and a standard pay is maintained across the hierarchy.

-	All information generated while working on a project, will be made public once the project is completed or becomes invalid. This will allow others to audit and see if there are any lapses.


## Internal Investigation:

When a critical incident is filed, it should have verifiable proof, it will be documented and an investigation will be conducted by the facilitators in the shortest possible time.

Once the chair or facilitator(s) receive a critical incident, they will first decide with a poll if this needs furthur through inverstigation or the proof provided is not sufficient or the case is not to be considered. The poll will need a 51% majority.

In case an investigation is recommended then:

- The person who is under investigation will have to step down voluntarily or be releaved from his/her duties with immediate effect till the investigation is completed. In case the incidnt is filed against the chiar or facilitator(s) an election has to be conducted to choose a temporary replacement.

- If the critical incident is against a group then that group facilitator(s) will not be part of the investigation team and will also be temporarily removed from creative layer till the investigation is complete. The group will function normally till the investigation is completed, but will not be allowed to tamper with the investigation in any manner.

- If the investigation finds that the person who filed the critical report was having malicious intent and wanted to cause harm to the concerned person or group, then he will be terminated with immediate effect.
