# Budgets

Each quarter the facilitator(s) have to put forward their budget requirements in consultation with their team. Each facilitator will put forward their budget requirements in the creative group for discussions. As the budgets have to be divided between the teams, the facilitator(s) should provide the necessary arguments for the budgets to be justified.

Following are the guidelines to be followed:

- The budget should include all costs to the team, including salary for team or other hires, projects, events, promotions and anything which has to be paid for the group.

- Budgets to be provided for the next quarter after the facilitator(s) election, but before the embassy budget ratifying session. This will help the chair get the requested budget allocated for the branch at the stratergy layer.

-	Budgets will be based on each group's performance in the past, which will help them secure a bigger budget.
