# Budgets

Each quarter the facilitator(s) have to put forward their budget requirements in consultation with their team. Each group facilitator will put forward their budget requirements in the creative group for discussions. As the budgets have to be divided between the teams, the facilitator(s) should provide the necessary arguments for the budgets to be justified.

Following are the guidelines to be followed:

- Budgets to be provided for the next quarter after the facilitator(s) election, but before the embassy budget ratifying session. This will help the chair get the requested budget allocated for the branch at the stratergy layer.

- The budget should include all costs to the team, including renumeration for whole team or other hires, projects, events, promotions and anything which has to be paid for by the group.

-	Budgets will be based on each group's performance in the past quarter, which will help them secure a bigger budget.

- The crypto markets are volatile and the branch is mandated to keep reserves when the markets are bullish and go in conservation mode during bearish times. (We expect price stability once we have use-cases).

- The whole branch has to move fast to cut down expenses in case of a market downturn or unforseen event which might shrink the budgets.

- Budget cuts will also involve laying of the team members in a worst case scenario. This will be decided at the creative layer.
