# Departure

> **NOTE:** People working in the DAO are privy to confidential information and handle credentials for the platforms they manage.
{.is-info}


When a team member wants to resign / depart, he will submit a resignation letter in a written format which can be documented and the facilitator will follow the procedure below: 

-	If the facilitator is quitting, he will inform the chair. The chair will ask the working group to vote for a new facilitator.

-	Facilitator will assign a person to take over the duties and to ensure smooth transition. 

-	Take charge of all the credentials managed by the person and change them.

-	Conduct audits on all the things managed by the person and ensure that his reliever gives a clear statement. 

-	Relieve the person and ask the person to leave the channel after the farewell.

- Once everything is cleared and confirmed, give a public statement that the said person is leaving the arm and has cleared all things.

-	The Intention to leave, audit report with all the findings and any other related things to be documented by the facilitator.

-	If the person is joining another arm then he can only join when all the above process is completed.

This process will avoid any misunderstanding or problems in case of any untoward incident in the future. This will also avoid mud slinging and blame games once a person leaves amicably. 


## Termination
If a team member is terminated, the same procedure will be followed, except the person will have to be removed from the group immediately and the team will reset all the credentials used by the person and conduct an audit asap.
