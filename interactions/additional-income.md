# Income From Services
The Interaction team plans to run and maintain self sustaining services, which means we will be charging for services provided by the arm. This money will go towards the operational cost of infrastructure, remuneration and also to provide new services.

Today we have severe budget constriants due to low NXS price, which has led us to explore the self sustaining model and also we can provide services to use-cases and infrastructure support which will benefit Nexus directly. In the future when NXS price increases we still can be a self sustaining arm and will not have to fully depend on budgets and can get more things done.

This document will lay out the guidelines to manage this income and see the money is not misused.

- All the services will be charged in NXS only.
- All the charges will be credited to seperate accounts on the Interactions sigchain. This will enable full audit for each project.
- Proceeds only go to fund the project which is generating it until it becomes self sufficient and starts earning more than the operating cost, then the creative layer can decide where the money can be utilized.
- This money can only be invested into projects and services which can directly or indirectly benefit Nexus growth and reach.
