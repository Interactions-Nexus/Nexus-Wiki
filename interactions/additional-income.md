# Additional Income
The Interaction team wants to create systems which are self sustaining, this is not about creating income, but a way to manage the cost of Infrastructure and other systems which is required to maintain, pay devs.

Today the issue is compounded due to the low NXS price which makes it very difficult to get things done due to limited budgets. In the future when the price increases we still can be a fully self sustaining arm and will not have to depend on the budgets and can get more things done.
