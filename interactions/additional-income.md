# Additional Income
The Interaction team plans to create systems which are self sustaining, which means we will be charging for services provided by the arm. This money will go towards the operational the cost of infrastructure, remuneration and also to provide new services.

As of today we have severe budget constriants due to very low NXS price, which has led us to this self sustaining model and also we can increase services to use-cases and provide infrastructural support which will benifit Nexus directly. In the future when NXS price increases we still can be a fully self sustaining arm and will not have to fully depend on budgets and can get more things done.

This document will lay out the guidelines, how to manage this income and see that things are not misused.

- All the services will be charged in NXS only.
- All the charges will be credited to seperate accounts on the Interactions sigchain. This will enable full auditability for each project.
- Proceeds only go to fund the project which is generating it until it becomes self sufficient and starts earning more than the operating cost, then the creative layer can decide where the money can be utilized.
