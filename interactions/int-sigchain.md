## Sigchain Responsibility

The responsibility to manage the sigchain lies with the Interactions chair and no one else will have access to it, in case a chair steps down or is voted out, the signature chain has to be transferred to the new chair immediately or else the sigchain has to be reset to prevent misuse.

The new chair is responsible to change the credentials asap for the signature chain to prevent misuse and will be held responsible for any mismanagement. 

Any transfer or receving of Sigchain credentials has to be informed to the creative layer and documented for future reference.

- The chair is responsible to pay team members based on invoices received, but after checking and making sure the invoice is filled as described in the template and conforms to the agreed remuneration and there is no overcharging. In case the chair needs more clarity he can approach the concerned group facilitator(s).
