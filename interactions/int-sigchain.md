# Interactions - Signature Chain
The interactions signature chain is where the funds are alloted funds are stored and all team member invoices are paid.

> The embassy has the **recovery phrase** to the branch sigchain and in case of misuse the branch creative layer is responsible for resetting the signature chain.

## Sigchain Responsibility

The responsibility to manage the sigchain lies with the Interactions chair and no one else will have access to it, in case a chair steps down or is voted out, the signature chain has to be transferred to the new chair immediately or else the sigchain has to be reset to prevent misuse.

The new chair is responsible to change the credentials asap for the signture chain to prevent misuse and will be held responsible for any mismanagement. 

Any transfer of Sigchain credentials has to be informed to the creative layer and documented for future reference.

- The chair will invoice the embassy for the allocated funds by 26th of each month and is responsible to invoice is filled per the template. 

- The chair is responsible to pay team members based on invoices received, but after checking and making sure the invoice is filled as described in the template and conforms to the agreed renumeration and there is no overcharging. In case the chair needs more clarity he can aproach the concerned group facilitator(s).
