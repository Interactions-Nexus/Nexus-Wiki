# Performance Review

Every group(s) and member(s) in the arm will be monitored and there will be performance reviews. Chair and facilitator(s) will be responsible to evaluate their group members performance and if the any member(s) performance is unsatisfactory, a incident report will be initiated. A total of three incident reports on any member(s) will automatically initiate disciplinary action resulting in termination. 


## Leave of Absence

Everyone in the arm is entitled for 4 days (has to be finalized) leave in a month. Every team member, facilitator(s) or chair will have to take approval from the facilitator(s) or chair for any leave of absence of more than a day. Failure to do so will result in disciplinary action.

## Non-Performace ( Team or team member):

Every team member in the Interactions arm will be monitored by the creative layer and chair. Non-performance for longer duration will not be tolerated unless it falls in the exception catergory. If a member(s) performance is below par, a incident report will be initiated.

## Exception Category:
1.	In case of long-term illness which lasts more than a week.
2.	In case of accident which makes it difficult to work for more than a week.
3.	Disability or condition which makes a person unfit to work for an extended period or time.
4.	Approved long leave of absence.


## Unfit to work for Interactions:
There may be cases where a person may not be fit to work for Interactions, a few are mentioned below:
- Does not beleive in the DAO constituition, arm internal processes or the vision of Nexus.
- Conflict of interest which creates undue advantage to the member or any third party which the Chair and facilitators(s) are not informed in advance.
- Non performance for long time.
- Any such conditions which inhibits the member(s) ability to perform his duties.
