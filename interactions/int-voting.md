# Voting

The working group(s) will vote for the team facilitator(s), to represent them in the creative layer. The newly elected facilitator(s) will vote for the chair to represent the arm in the strategy layer. The voting has to be completed by the end of the current quarter and can spill over to 10 days of the next quarter.

The arm groups have to conduct facilitator(s) election and then the elected facilitator(s) will vote for the chair every quarter without fail.



## Voting for Facilitator:

The working group(s) will vote for the team facilitator(s), to represent them in the creative layer. Every group has to complete the voting to choose their facilitator by the current quarter and the proof has to be provided to the Chair.

#### Requirements, Selection and Voting Process for Facilitator(s):

-	The facilitator(s) election had to take place every quarter without fail. Tenure for a elected facilitator is one quarter.

-	The facilitator(s) must alert their group of the election cycle, and ask them if they would like to nominate a challenger. If challenger(s) are nominated, a open poll is created including challenger(s) and current facilitator.

-	To be considered as a nominee for facilitator the person should have performed duties for a minimum of 90 days in the capacity of team member.

-	Team member(s) can nominate a challenger to the current facilitator. 

- Self-nomination is not allowed.

-	The elected facilitator(s) needs to have a majority of 51%.

-	The whole process of selection and voting should be transparent, and proof has to be provided to the chair. This will be provided to the community and embassy after chair election.

## Voting for Chair:

The newly elected facilitator(s) for the next quarter will come together to vote for the chair. If there is no challenger for the chair, then all will vote saying that they support the existing chair for another term.


#### Requirements, Selection and Voting Process for Chair:

## Failure to Complete Voting:

The chair has to ensure that each group completes the facilitator(s) election in time or has to vote out the facilitator(s) for the group.  

The facilitator(s) are responsible to ensure the chair election is carried out in the stipulated time and if not completed have to vote out the exisiting chair.

If the arm voting is not done by 10 days into the new quarter the chair looses his authority and the facilitator(s) have to conduct the election at the earliest.

All elections only need 51% votes in the groups or creative layer and if any team member(s) or facilitator(s) is missing or abstaining can be overlooked.

## Voting on Proposals

Any proposal will be voted at the group level or at the creative layer and the concerned person will present a written proposal and after everyone has read it, a poll will be created. The propsoal will require a majority vote of 51% to be passed. If the voting is at the group level, the proof has to be submitted to other facilitator(s).
