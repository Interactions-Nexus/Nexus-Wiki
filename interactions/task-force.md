# Combined Task Force

In the past being a community driven project we have faced a lot of issues when dealing with use-cases one arm dealing with the use-cases creates a lot of issues. 

To counter the problem we have decided to tackle this issue we have decided to have a dedicated task force for each use-case. This task force will reduce the chances of corruption to an extent and to make it fool proof we have to follow the following processes.

The task force will be decide by the stratergy layer
Responsibilities of each person in the task force will be pre determined and there will be no stepping on other toes.
