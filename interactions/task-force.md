# Combined Task Force

In the past being a community driven project we have faced a lot of issues when dealing with use-cases, one arm, group or person dealing with use-cases has given way to corruption and manipulation which ultimately has led to that use-case being lost. 

To counter the problem, we have decided to create dedicated task force for each individual use-case. This task force will reduce the chances of corruption to an extent and to furthur make it fool proof, follow the task force processes outlined which should keep things in check.

## Task Force Processes

- The task force will be created at the stratergy layer in consultation with the use-case team and their requirement.

- The stratergy layer will be responsible to keep track of every task force progress.

- Chairs who constitute the stratergy layer cannot be part of the task force.

- The task force will consist of a minimum 2 people from the DAO. The task force strength can be increased if requested by the use-case team or the task force team. Developers can also be part of the task force if needed.
  
	-  Technical Advisor
	-  Observer

- Responsibilities of each person in the task force will be pre-determined and there will be no stepping on others toes.

- The task force and the use-case will create one single channel to communicate and it should be the only channel used for all the communication. This will make sure all communication has proof in case of any issues.

- All online meetings will be recorded.

- If this process is not followed the members can file an incident report at the stratergy layer.

- No member of the task force can charge any fees in cash, kind or equity from the use-case for providing consultation unless its authorized at the stratergy layer. 

## Who cannot be part of the task force:

- Anyone from the DAO who is associated or working with that particular use-case in any capacity direct or indirect. 
- Anyone from the DAO who is helping the particular use-case to build their dapp or consulting for a fee at any point of the process.
- Any person from the DAO with any conflict of interest with the particular use-case, which can cause issues should be avoided.
