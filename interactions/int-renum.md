# Renumeration

Interactions renumerations will be decided by the facilitator(s) at the creative layer and ratified depending on budget allotments and other variables like crypto market, Nexus development, adoption and the total number of people in the arm.

The facilitator(s) will follow the below guidelines to set the renumeration for each person in the Interactions team.

-	The renumeration will be dependent on the arm budget, which will be split between the various groups in the branch.

- The branch creative layer has to make sure that they have comfortable reserves in case of market downturn. A bullish market is a good time to increase reserves. 

-	The renumeration will be decided by the facilitator(s) at the creative layer with consensus of 51%.

-	Having a standard pay for working groups with different skill set is not the best way, but a standard pay for the same skill set is advised. Then based on performance the renmeration can be increased.

- THe renumeration will also vary depending if the member(s) is working full time or part time in the branch.

-	There can be extra incentives for better performance over the standard pay. But this can also be misused and has to carefully implemented.

-	Facilitator(s) have additional responsibility and they can add a percentage raise over the working team member pay.

-	Chair has additional responsibility above the facilitator(s) and they can add a percentage raise over the facilitator(s) pay.

-	The branch needs to be a set date for sending and paying out the invoices.

-	As the invoices are paid in NXS whose value is volatile, it is recommended to have an exchange rate set for each monthly invoice payout.

-	All invoices have to follow a standard invoice template, which makes sure that all the relevant information is provided. This also make it possible to sort search and create visualizations in future.


## Renumeration Revision
The crypto market being highly volatile and Nexus still being in its development stages, the revisions will be decided at the creative layer, but they need to keep the following points in mind:

- Any renumeration revision has to be voted with a majority of 51%

- To maintain comfortable reserves during bull markets and conserve in time of bear markets.

- The monthly outgoing should not exceed the monthly allocation for the branch.

- In case of bear markets or any unforseen events which reduce the branch budgets the facilitator(s) have to revise renumeration in sync with market conditions.

- The team has to have caps on certain activities where members can invoice unlimited hours like translating social media posts or any other activity which does not create immense value and can be misused.


## Employee Retention:

Interactions arm will follow the fire fast and promote faster principle to retain the best talent and meritocracy. As our arm heirarchy is based on voting, promotion will mean increased renumeration only. Interactions facilitator(s) will make sure to retain the best talent, but at the same time it will terminate people who are under performers.

- In case of a bullish market, the team can have faster revisions to be in sync with markets and also hire new talent.
