# Renumeration

Interactions renumerations is decided by and is voted by the facilitators. This will be decided at the creative layer and ratified depending on budget allotments and other  variables like crypto market, Nexus development, adoption and the total no of people in the arm.

The facilitator(s) will follow the below guidelines to set the renumeration for each person in the Interactions team.

-	The pay will be dependent on the arm budget, which will be split between the various groups in the branch.

-	The pay will be decided by the facilitator(s) with consensus of 51%.

-	Having a standard pay for working groups with different skill set is not the best way, but for a same skill set a standard pay can be set. Then based on performance the renmeration can be increased.

-	There can be extra incentives for better performance over the standard pay. But this can also be misused and has to carefully implemented.

-	Facilitator(s) have additional responsibility and they can add a percentage raise over the working team member pay.

-	Chair has additional responsibility above the facilitator(s) and they can add a percentage raise over the facilitator(s) pay.

-	There needs to be a set date for sending and paying out the invoices.

-	As the invoices are paid in NXS whose value is volatile, it is recommended to have an exchange rate set for each monthly invoice payout.

-	All invoices have to follow a standard invoice template, which makes sure that all the relevant information is provided. This also make it possible to sort search and create visualizations in future.

# Employee Retention:

Interactions arm will follow the fire fast and promote faster principle to retain the best talent. As our arm heirarchy is based on voting, promotion will mean increased renumeration only. Interactions will make sure to retain the best talent, but at the same time it will let go of people who are not performing.
