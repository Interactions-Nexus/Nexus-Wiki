# 🎮 Gaming

### Traditional Gaming <a href="#why-does-gaming-need-blockchain" id="why-does-gaming-need-blockchain"></a>

In traditional games, users buy the game – play it. As the user continues playing, he finds and discovers weapons, gear, and other items within the game. The user uses this equipment to fight, defend himself, etc. What happens when the user stops playing the game?

User no longer needs those items or weapons found or purchased. All the work and time the user puts into the game, the assets are now meaningless. User's cannot use them in another game or  he can sell them either because they are not his property.

### Blockchain Gaming

On a high level, they work similarly to traditional games. Users play, find and discover items, weapons, and gear and use or equip those items while playing the game. However, the key difference with their traditional counterparts is that the assets exist outside of the game.

When users turn off the game or stop playing altogether, user can use the items, for example, a sword or a shield, in another game, sell them on an external market or convert them into cryptocurrency. Blockchain makes each item unique and transferrable.

Blockchain allows users to create items and store their information. For example, the requirements might be to create an asset, name it, have a picture to go along with that item, define the quantity and the ownership of these items. It would look similar to this:

* Sword
* Picture of the Sword
* Name of the Game
* NO: 1 out of 100
* Owner (Mutable) - the game creator, can be transferred and changed to new owner

Then the creator of the asset submits this data to the blockchain.  Now, since this blockchain asset exists and we know that there are 100 golden shields, the person who holds them can give these assets away by transferring them on the blockchain.

For example, user wants to send this shield to a gamer named Aeon4586, who won it in a giveaway competition. User transfers it to that gamer, and it is then stored in his Signature chain. Now, it is recorded on the blockchain that Aeon4586 is one of the 100 owners of the golden shield. Anyone can verify this by checking the asset name or register address.

### Advantages of Blockchain Games

* A player officially and provably owns game assets.
* The Asset information is recorded on the blockchain for everyone to see.
* Games will check the blockchain to see what assets a player owns.
* Blockchain game developers decide whether to include this item in their game.
* Blockchain games become a multiverse, where gamers can use assets across different games, sell them at auctions, and put them on a marketplace outside the game.
* Players are free to send or sell their items peer to peer.
* The time a player spends in a game to own in-game assets will not be a total waste and can be monetized.
* Anyone can create an asset outside the game and that can be included in a game later.

### Conclusion

Blockchain technology is still new, but it has a lot of potential for building exciting and engaging games. The combination of games and metaverse is the new trend , which is going to explode in popularity. We expect to see a lot more development in the coming years.

Building blockchain games is not very different from blockchain app development, but there are nuances that you need to keep in mind before you start building, including your game model and the blockchain that you will use. Nexus makes is really easy to integrate blockchain functionality in existing games with the REST API's.

Finally, blockchain gaming can change the way we play. It will be a complete transformation from how the games are funded to how players interact with each other and developers. Now, it’s the best time to start experimenting with the different possibilities, especially if you’re already familiar with blockchain technology.

Blockchain-based games assets are decentralized and give people the opportunity to win real money or prizes. All these features make blockchain based games exciting, even for players who don’t usually enjoy these types of games.
