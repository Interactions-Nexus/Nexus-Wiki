# 🏫 Assets - NFT's

&nbsp;

## **What is an Asset (NFT)?**

Assets, commonly known as NFT's (non-fungible token). Assets are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. They let us digitally represent things like art, collectibles, even real estate and a lot of other things. They can only have one official owner (sigchain) at a time and they're secured by the Nexus blockchain;  except the owner no one can modify the record of ownership.

An Asset can only have one owner (user account / sigchain) at a time. Ownership is managed through the uniqueID (Asset Name) and metadata that no other token can replicate. Assets are minted and are assigned ownership to the particular user account (Sigchain).&#x20;

NFT's can be transferred to other users which transfers the ownership of the Asset to that particular user. Assets provide the use of mutable metadata like the "_Owner Field"_ for a house which is minted as an asset. The new owner then can change the Owner field to reflect his name as the owner of the house.

&nbsp;

## Asset  Properties:

* Each Asset minted has a unique Name & Register Address that is directly linked to the owner (user account / sigchain).
* Assets are not directly interchangeable with other tokens 1:1. For example 1 NXS is exactly the same as another ETH. This isn't the case with Assets.
* Each Asset has an owner and this information is easily verifiable.
* Assets are native to Nexus and can be bought and sold on any Nexus powered Asset market or via the on-chain P2P marketplace.
* Asset metadata fields can be selected as mutable during minting and this metadata can be changed anytime by the owner of that Asset.
* Assets can be tokenised for fractional ownership.
