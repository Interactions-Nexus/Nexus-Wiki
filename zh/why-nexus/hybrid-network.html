<h1>🌎 混合网络</h1>
<p>如今，完全去中心化的区块链仍处于起步阶段，可扩展性阻碍了其全部潜力。 有许多扩展技术正在集成，如 Lightning 和 Plasma，它们声称可以解决可扩展性问题，但第 2 层解决方案并不是扩展完全去中心化区块链的最佳方法。</p>
<p>Nexus 麟社根据用例和要求设计了两种不同的扩展解决方案，第一种是混合网络。 Nexus 麟社被设计成一个混合网络。 混合网络将解决其他区块链面临的许多问题，例如敏感客户端数据的可扩展性、隐私和安全性。</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Nexus core is used to run the public, private and hybrid nodes and the configuration sets them apart.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What is a Hybrid Network?</h2>
<p>Hybrid networks allows a private and public chains hybrid user account to exist as a single entity. A particular private network is linked to the public chain with a unique hybrid user account. This allows the company's sensitive sales and finance data on the private chain to be truly private and secure, but still be secured with the public chain by creating a state recording checkpoints on the public network. Hybrid network can have their own consensus mechanisms implemented if required.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Hybrid Network</h2>
<p>Hybrid networks lets the Nexus chain to scale horizontally, as it offloads processing to the private nodes and that creates parallel processing chains. When a lot of hybrid networks join the public chain the Nexus blockchain can scale massively while still preserving privacy and security of the private networks. The Hybrid chain will be the preferred way for enterprises and organisations to embrace and shift to blockchain.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It will be the defacto choice of Enterprises and Corporations. They will have full control and privacy for their sensitive data, while also able to transact on the public network.</li>
  <li>As all the private chain computation is offloaded to dedicated private nodes it becomes fast and cheap</li>
  <li>No fess for any operation on private side of the hybrid networks</li>
  <li>Data security and scalability</li>
</ul>

  <p>More details on Hybrid Networks will be provided as the development is completed.</p>
