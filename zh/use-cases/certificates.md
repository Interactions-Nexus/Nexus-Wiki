# 📰 Certificates

Educational degrees are a key part of our education system.

It offers validity to someone’s skill and offers insight into what they are capable of. However, they are hard to verify and carry. It is also easy to commit fraud and can lead to cases where candidates get jobs that they do not deserve. The solution to all of these is a blockchain-powered-certificate-verification system.

The candidates can now get digital certificates and degrees. All these are digitally generated with the help of blockchain. They are associated with the digital identity of the candidate and hence can be verified at any time. The certificates are also accessible by the person anywhere, which makes them more manageable and easier to access.

This practical use case of blockchain can be implemented worldwide among universities, online courses and more.
