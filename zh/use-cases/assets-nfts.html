<h1 class="toc-header" id="assets-nfts"> üè´ Assets - NFT's</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="toc-header" id="what-is-an-asset-nft"> <strong>What is an Asset (NFT)?</strong></h2>
<p>Assets, commonly known as NFT's (non-fungible token). Assets are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. They let us digitally represent things like art, collectibles, even real estate and a lot of other things. They can only have one official owner (sigchain) at a time and they're secured by the Nexus blockchain;  except the owner no one can modify the record of ownership.</p>
<p>An Asset can only have one owner (user account / sigchain) at a time. Ownership is managed through the uniqueID (Asset Name) and metadata that no other token can replicate. Assets are minted and are assigned ownership to the particular user account (Sigchain). </p>
<p>NFT's can be transferred to other users which transfers the ownership of the Asset to that particular user. Assets provide the use of mutable metadata like the "<em>Owner Field"</em> for a house which is minted as an asset. The new owner then can change the Owner field to reflect his name as the owner of the house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="toc-header" id="asset-properties"> Asset  Properties:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each Asset minted has a unique Name &amp; Register Address that is directly linked to the owner (user account / sigchain).</li>
<li>Assets are not directly interchangeable with other tokens 1:1. For example 1 NXS is exactly the same as another ETH. This isn't the case with Assets.</li>
<li>Each Asset has an owner and this information is easily verifiable.</li>
<li>Assets are native to Nexus and can be bought and sold on any Nexus powered Asset market or via the on-chain P2P marketplace.</li>
<li>Asset metadata fields can be selected as mutable during minting and this metadata can be changed anytime by the owner of that Asset.</li>
<li>Assets can be tokenised for fractional ownership.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
