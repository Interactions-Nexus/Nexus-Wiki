<h1>🏫 资产 - NFT's 非同质化通证</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>什么是资产<strong> (NFT </strong>非同质化通证<strong>)?</strong></h2>
<p>Assets, commonly known as NFT's (non-fungible token). Assets are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. They let us digitally represent things like art, collectibles, even real estate and a lot of other things. They can only have one official owner (sigchain) at a time and they're secured by the Nexus blockchain; except the owner no one can modify the record of ownership.</p>
<p>资产，俗称 NFT's (non-fungible token 非同质化通证)。 资产是我们可以用来表示独特物品持有权的通证。 它们让我们以数字方式呈现艺术品、收藏品、甚至房地产和许多其他事物。 他们一次只能拥有一个官方所有者（sigchain），并且由 Nexus 区块链保护； 除了所有者，没有人可以修改所有权记录。</p>
<p>An Asset can only have one owner (user account / sigchain) at a time. Ownership is managed through the uniqueID (Asset Name) and metadata that no other token can replicate. Assets are minted and are assigned ownership to the particular user account (Sigchain).</p>
<p>NFT's can be transferred to other users which transfers the ownership of the Asset to that particular user. Assets provide the use of mutable metadata like the "<i>Owner Field"</i> for a house which is minted as an asset. The new owner then can change the Owner field to reflect his name as the owner of the house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Asset Properties:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Each Asset minted has a unique Name &amp; Register Address that is directly linked to the owner (user account / sigchain).</li>
  <li>Assets are not directly interchangeable with other tokens 1:1. For example 1 NXS is exactly the same as another ETH. This isn't the case with Assets.</li>
  <li>Each Asset has an owner and this information is easily verifiable.</li>
  <li>Assets are native to Nexus and can be bought and sold on any Nexus powered Asset market or via the on-chain P2P marketplace.</li>
  <li>Asset metadata fields can be selected as mutable during minting and this metadata can be changed anytime by the owner of that Asset.</li>
  <li>Assets can be tokenised for fractional ownership.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where can we use Assets?</h3>
<p>Assets can be used for various use-cases both digital and physical. Listed below are a few use-cases:<br>&nbsp;</p>
