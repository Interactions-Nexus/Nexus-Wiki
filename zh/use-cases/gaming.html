<h1>🎮 电子游戏</h1>
<h3>传统电子游戏</h3>
<p>在传统游戏中，用户购买游戏玩它。 随着用户继续玩游戏，他会在游戏中找到并发现武器、装备和其他物品。 用户使用此设备进行战斗、自卫等。当用户停止玩游戏时会发生什么？</p>
<p>用户不再需要去寻找或购买的那些物品或武器。 用户投入游戏的所有工作和时间，资产现在毫无意义。 用户不能在其他游戏中使用它们，或者他可以出售它们，因为它们不是他的财产。</p>
<h3>区块链电子游戏</h3>
<p>在高层次上，它们的工作方式与传统游戏类似。 用户在玩游戏时玩、寻找和发现物品、武器和装备，并使用或装备这些物品。 然而，与传统对手的主要区别在于资产存在于游戏之外。</p>
<p>当用户关闭游戏或完全停止游戏时，用户可以在另一个游戏中使用这些物品，例如剑或盾，在外部市场上出售它们或将它们转换为加密货币。 区块链使每件物品都独一无二且可转让。</p>
<p>区块链允许用户创建项目并存储他们的信息。 例如，需求可能是创建资产、为其命名、为该项目配上图片、定义这些项目的数量和所有权。 它看起来类似于：</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sword</li>
  <li>Picture of the Sword</li>
  <li>Name of the Game</li>
  <li>NO: 1 out of 100</li>
  <li>Owner (Mutable) - the game creator, can be transferred and changed to new owner</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the creator of the asset submits this data to the blockchain. Now, since this blockchain asset exists and we know that there are 100 golden shields, the person who holds them can give these assets away by transferring them on the blockchain.</p>
<p>For example, user wants to send this shield to a gamer named Aeon4586, who won it in a giveaway competition. User transfers it to that gamer, and it is then stored in his Signature chain. Now, it is recorded on the blockchain that Aeon4586 is one of the 100 owners of the golden shield. Anyone can verify this by checking the asset name or register address.</p>
<h3>Advantages of Blockchain Games</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A player officially and provably owns game assets.</li>
  <li>The Asset information is recorded on the blockchain for everyone to see.</li>
  <li>Games will check the blockchain to see what assets a player owns.</li>
  <li>Blockchain game developers decide whether to include this item in their game.</li>
  <li>Blockchain games become a multiverse, where gamers can use assets across different games, sell them at auctions, and put them on a marketplace outside the game.</li>
  <li>Players are free to send or sell their items peer to peer.</li>
  <li>The time a player spends in a game to own in-game assets will not be a total waste and can be monetized.</li>
  <li>Anyone can create an asset outside the game and that can be included in a game later.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Blockchain technology is still new, but it has a lot of potential for building exciting and engaging games. The combination of games and metaverse is the new trend , which is going to explode in popularity. We expect to see a lot more development in the coming years.</p>
<p>Building blockchain games is not very different from blockchain app development, but there are nuances that you need to keep in mind before you start building, including your game model and the blockchain that you will use. Nexus makes is really easy to integrate blockchain functionality in existing games with the REST API's.</p>
<p>Finally, blockchain gaming can change the way we play. It will be a complete transformation from how the games are funded to how players interact with each other and developers. Now, it’s the best time to start experimenting with the different possibilities, especially if you’re already familiar with blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Blockchain-based games assets are decentralized and give people the opportunity to win real money or prizes. All these features make blockchain based games exciting, even for players who don’t usually enjoy these types of games.</p>
