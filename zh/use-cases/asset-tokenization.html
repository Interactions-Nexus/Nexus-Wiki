<h1>🖼 通证化资产</h1>
<p><strong>Asset Tokenization 资产通证化</strong>也称为 “资产支持通证” 或 “代币化资产”，是一个新概念，它使用数字通证将财产、珠宝或美术等资产的持有权细分，并使用区块链上的合约来管理这些持有权。</p>
<p>在 Nexus 麟社上，资产通证化是发行人创建代表数字或实物资产的资产、可替代通证，然后将它们链接在一起（通证化）的过程。通证现在代表该特定资产。</p>
<p>观看下面的视频，其中解释了资产通证化。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>为什么选择 Nexus 麟社进行资产通证化？</h3>
<p>Nexus 麟社区块链为希望对资产进行通证化的各种类型的用户提供了很多好处。 首先，任何用户都可以使用钱包界面对资产进行通证化，并从代码中抽象出来，编写智能合约或处理第三方通证化服务。</p>
<p>它允许使用界面中的链上 P2P&nbsp;点对点市场模块直接创建和销售链上资产。 铸造资产、通证和免费转移通证的成本很低。 当用户向资产发送支付时，它会自动按照当时持有的通证比例支付给资产通证持有人。</p>
<p>Asset Tokenization 资产通证化可以将许多行业和投资者的交互方式从现有的中介系统转变为 P2P 点对点系统。 这可以创建无边界网络，投资者、企业和社区可以在没有中央机构的情况下相互互动。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>为什么通证优于传统资产？</h3>
<p>通证化的主要好处来自通过增强合约实现的自动化，算法只有在满足特定条件时才会开始行动。 增强合约使中介机构变得多余，从而节省了成本、额外的 IT 基础设施来管理部分持有权的记录和间接费用。</p>
<p>一般来说，债券和股票是高流动性资产，以电子形式由机构控制。 相比之下，车辆、房地产、珠宝、艺术品和收藏品等资产缺乏高交易量、交易所交易机会和流动性。</p>
<p>使用 Nexus 麟社增强合约，它将既便宜又快捷。 P2P 点对点市场将使用户能够在链上进行买卖，这将带来更高的安全性并让更多人可以访问。</p>

<h3>Advantages of Asset Tokenization</h3>
<p>Tokenization is poised to become the next big thing in the financial markets because it provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fractional Ownership</strong> <strong>Enables Low Minimum Investment Threshold:</strong> In the traditional financial world, investment barriers can be extremely high. Think about the amount of investment required to buy a real estate asset or a piece of art. Tokenization, enables fractional ownership of an asset, which in turn lowers the minimum investment threshold, allowing even small retail investors to diversify their portfolios and enter the previously exclusive markets that were only available for large investors and beyond their reach.</li>
  <li><strong>Liquidity</strong> – By converting real-world asset to token backed, issuers can secure greater liquidity. For example, private securities are typically illiquid, which affects the trading process on secondary markets. Thanks to tokenization, this problem can be addressed to give investors more freedom to implement various strategies on scarcer assets. This enables anyone to tokenise their asset.</li>
  <li><strong>No Territorial Barriers:</strong> An investor can invest in a property located in any part of the world without visiting there physically. Investment becomes secure, fast and easy with asset tokenization on the blockchain.</li>
  <li><strong>No Administrative Burden:</strong> Tokenized assets allow faster transactions with no administrative burden. Through the use of Advanced contracts cumbersome manual processes, clearing and settlement processes will be automated, streamlined, efficient and simplified.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Traceability and Validation:</strong> With an immutable record of ownership, tokenized assets allow for improved traceability and transparency. Each record is documented on an immutable shared ledger that contains the whole history of activities performed over an asset. This ensures that relevant parties have a clear view of the updated ledger of ownership records. This also helps anyone verify themselves before they invest preventing fraud.‍</li>
  <li><strong>Fast and Cheap:</strong> Modern blockchains not only enable fast and low-cost transactions, but also removes the intermediaries and this relates to the tokenized assets as well. Nexus is designed for high throughput with free simple transactions and low asset minting fees. This could speed up the adoption of tokenization as the main approach to deal with real-world assets.</li>
  <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Blockchain has become one of the most important technologies thanks to its unique attributes, including immutability and transparency. Once a blockchain transaction has achieved finality, it cannot be reversed, canceled, or tampered with in any way. Nexus ensures that anyone can cheap the authenticity of the assets being sol</li>
  <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Today, everyone can get exposure to stocks by buying shares or speculate on their price via derivatives through online platforms operated by intermediaries. The internet has transformed the way we invest, but blockchain can do even more by making the investment process more convenient, direct, secure and accessible.</li>
  <li><strong>Equal Opportunity Provider:</strong> Asset Tokenization will give an opportunity for ordinary people, banked or unbanked to take part in investments. Today the more lucrative investments are not available to the general public and limited to accredited investors. Asset Tokenization will get rid of intermediaries which will create a more level playing field.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What can be tokenized?</strong></h3>
<p>The possibilities are endless as tokenization allows for both fractional ownership and proof-of-ownership. From traditional assets like venture capital funds, bonds, commodities, and real-estate properties to exotic assets like sports teams, race horses, artwork, and celebrities, companies worldwide use blockchain technology to tokenize almost anything.</p>
<p><strong>Assets:</strong> An asset is any item of value that someone can transform into cash. It’s further divided into two classes: personal and business. Personal assets can include art and property. Business assets include assets that are present on the balance sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Equity</strong>: Equity (shares) can be tokenized; however, the assets remain in the digital form of security tokens stored online in a wallet. It's similar to how investors typically buy shares on a stock exchange.</p>
<p><strong>Funds:</strong> An investment fund is a type of asset that investors can tokenize, these tokens represent an investors' share of the fund. Each investor is provided tokens which represent their share of the fund.</p>
<p><strong>Services:</strong> A business can offer goods or services as a way to raise funds or conduct business. Investors can use tokens to purchase goods or services provided by the supplier.</p>
<p><strong>Commodities:</strong> Many commodities will benefit from tokenization. The assets with strong value propositions are the ones to benefit from this process the most. Precious metals like palladium, platinum, and rhodium are currently being tokenized.</p>
<p><strong>Startups:</strong> Startups are a risky bet, but if they take off there is a lot of money to be made. Today normal people do not have easy access to invest in startups. They need a lot of capital and being risky it is difficult to secure capital in the traditional setup and this space is ruled by Venture Capitalists. Tokenizing a startup will make it easier to secure capital and also cater to a bigger populace and also it will make genuine startups to make a real difference.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
