<h1>操作费用</h1>
<p>Nexus has fees for the various operations on the public chain like creating assets, invoices, names and tokens. This is to maintain security of the network, prevent misuse, spam and resource squatting.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The fees are only applicable for the mainnet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The breakdown of fees for all operation types is as follows:</p>

          <p>The fee calculation for creating a token is based on the number of total supply of token divisible units, which in turn is calculated from the token supply and the number of decimals in the token definition.&nbsp;<br>For example, a token with supply 1,000,000 and 2 decimals has a total of 100,000,000 divisible units. The actual fee calculation is a logarithmic scale based on this number, using the formula:</p>
          <p>Fee = (log10(divisible units) – 2) * 100</p>
          <p>A minimum fee of 1 NXS always applies. This yields the following fees based on number of divisible units</p>
          <p>100 = 1 NXS<br>1,000 = 100 NXS<br>100,000 = 300 NXS<br>1,000,000 = 400 NXS<br>1,000,000,000 = 700 NXS<br>1,000,000,000,000 = 1000 NXS</p>

          <p>A transaction fee is applied whenever a transaction is created within 10 seconds of the last transaction within a signature chain. The fee is calculated based on the number of contracts within the transaction at a rate of 0.01 NXS per contract, of which there can be a maximum of 100 (at the time of writing). Therefore the transaction fee will be between 0 and 1 NXS.</p>

<h2>Advanced Contract Execution Fee:</h2>
<p>When Advanced Contracts are launched (with core V7.0), except the basic contracts (which are already free) contract execution will be charged as they require computation cycles and the fee will be calculated before execution and the user will pay the exact fee shown, unlike GAS on Ethereum.</p>
