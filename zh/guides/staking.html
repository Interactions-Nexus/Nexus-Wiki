<h1>Staking 质押 (nPoS)</h1>
<p>本指南在于揭开基于信誉的质押的神秘面纱，并澄清 Nexus 麟社特定的中心化保护措施。 这种共识权力转移到 staking 质押的重要性怎么强调都不为过，尤其是考虑到新兴去中心化生态系统的脆弱治理状态。</p>
<h2>nPoS 简介</h2>
<p>Nexus 麟社基于信誉的权益证明 (PoS) 是一种更环保的挖矿形式，提供与工作量证明 (PoW) 渠道提供的类似共识属性，且管理开销最小。 找到区块的概率在很大程度上取决于抵押的代币数量。 它与硬件无关，而是基于其散列算法的平衡和权重。 这意味着没有固定的时间来获得奖励。 当你抵押一个区块时就会发生这种情况，这样做的机会随着抵押数量/抵押权重的增加而增加，并随着当前网络 PoS 通道的难度而降低。</p>
<p>Ultimately, the only thing that matters is that the wallet (node) finds a block once every 72 hours to keep growing stake rate. The reward itself is based on time, so frequency isn't important. If it takes 2 days then the reward is twice as much as if it takes one day. Once you stake a block then that node is locked for 240 blocks (120 min).</p>
<p>In PoW, if network hash rate increases, so does difficulty; similarly for PoS, more total coins staked on network = more difficulty. You can increase PoW hash rate by adding hardware, however hardware makes no difference for PoS. Effective PoS hash rate is increased by stake weight (block and trust weights) and staked amount.</p>
<p>True stake rewards, however, are not like earning interest. Staking rewards are given for running a node to secure blocks via consensus, similar to PoW rewards although generated differently.</p>
<p>Nexus has a total of 78 million native coins and these will be mined fully in 2024 with a tail end emissions / inflation of 3.67%. 3% will be for the PoS if all the nexus tokens are staked and 0.67% for the hash and prime mining channels.</p>
<p>Nexus provides desktop wallets for windows, mac and Linux. The mobile wallet (lite node only) is currently in public beta and will be released in H2 of 2022. As of today, Nexus only supports full-node staking, although the next major upgrade will also include pooled staking, with a minimum balance of 1 NXS.</p>
<p>Nexus staked holdings will also be valuable for voting in the upcoming DAO, where trust will be an crucial factor. Voting will supply weight/age values to trust and amount of staked NXS, providing considerable resistance against manipulation and bad actor influences.. Note: In the previous election conducted for Nexus embassy allocation, the amount of nxs for each vote was capped at 10K nxs + trust weight. This is currently not hard coded, but will be implemented in the upcoming DAO release. The threshold variables can be changed as per the requirement and also can be voted on by the community.</p>
