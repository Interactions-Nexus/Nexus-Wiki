&#x20;**Section 1**: There are three branches of an Embassy: viz. Legislative, Executive, and Judicial. Each of these branches performs a specific task related to the healthy functioning of an Embassy.

&#x20;**Section 2**: There is a monthly budget allocated to a given Embassy by voting members of the global Nexus ecosystem. This budget is not to be managed by any one branch but two of three branches must sign to resolve budgets between branches. Budget ratification between branches must be completed every 90 days, whether to adjust budgets or maintain the same allocation. At these intervals, a State of the Branch must be issued to the voting members of the Embassy.

**Section 3**: A branch is governed by a working body of no more than five individuals – each of whom have been elected as representatives of their given working groups. Each of these five representatives is allocated to facilitate strategic discussion, and is herein called a “chair”. Each chair is responsible for representing their groups budget requirements and signature chain – and facilitating consensus between their peers.

**Section 4**: An arm is governed by a working body of no more than eight individuals – each of whom have been elected as representatives of their base working groups. Peers within an arm are namely responsible for taking the overall strategy developed by the five chairs of their corresponding branch – and generating a list of tasks to be executed. If this is the base group, meaning there are not more than eight individuals in the arm, it is then considered a task execution group.

**Section 5**: Once an arm has established eight key roles, through the eight individuals, and it requires more personnel to complete the daily requirements – then it is appropriate for each of the eight individuals to form base groups of thirteen. A base group operates as the authority to elect representation – but also is the group responsible for task execution. If a group of thirteen – herein called a “node” has been formed by one of the eight individuals in the arm, then they are automatically the “node chair” until the next election cycle is to be held. If a node chair is not voted in on next election cycle – they are required to leave the arm’s group of eight, to be replaced with the new node chair.

**Section 6**: Election cycles for chairs will be held on intervals not exceeding ninety days. When an election cycle is executed – the chair must alert their group of the election cycle, and ask them if they would like to nominate a challenger. If challenger(s) are nominated, a poll is created including challenger(s) and current chair. Nominee’s are required to have been involved in a given arm for no less than 90 days, and cannot be ‘self nominated’. The results of the poll determines the chair until the next election cycle. If a chair is not re-elected, they must leave all group(s) above their peer group that just voted. Election of chair requires a majority to pass (greater than 51%); this threshold cannot be modified with any internal processes.

* chair must update group on quarterly basis to hold elections and provide proof
* chair must transfer group ownership to new chair if not re-elected

**Section 7**: If further capacity is needed in an arm, the group size can grow exponentially with the following group size layers:

   8 => 13 => 21 => 34 => 55 => 89 => 144

Each layer would require election cycles of representation to move to the next layer, outlined in _**Section 6**_.

**Section 8**: The working body of five individuals that govern a branch together vote to create a majority three of five for any of the following items:

* vote to ratify joint budget proposals.
* request incident response or investigative audit of another branch or arm.
* ratify incident response documents from another branch or arm.
* vote to ratify joint protocols for internal branch standardization across arms.
