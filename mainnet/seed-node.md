1.  **Seed Node definition**: A seed node is first node that other nodes connect to when they first come online. The seed node helps new nodes get the list of all the other nodes that are online. Â Once the new node has the list, it will begin connecting itself into the mesh.
2.  In order to make a see node, first follow the directions to create a Mainnet Node: [Run a Mainnet Node](https://wiki.nexus.io/en/mainnet/run-a-mainnet-node)
3.  Once you have your node running, there are a few additional steps:
    -   Add the following to nexus.conf:

```plaintext
#Unified time synchronization
unified=1
#Allow all IP's to connect to your node
llpallowip=*.*.*.*:9324
#Increase your maximum connections
maxincoming=303
maxconnections=333
```

-   Open ports 9324/tcp (unified time) and 9888/tcp (main data port)

```plaintext
sudo ufw allow 9324/tcp
sudo ufw allow 9888/tcp
```

1.  Ensure your node has a resolvable DNS name pointing to it.
2.  Contact an admin for the seed node working group to join the working group. Admins are:
    -   @aeonwise
    -   @Radient4751
3.  Once you are in the working group, we will add your node's DNS name to [seeds.cpp](https://github.com/Nexusoft/LLL-TAO/blob/merging/src/LLP/seeds.cpp) on GitHub.
