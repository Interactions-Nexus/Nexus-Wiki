# Receive Tokens

To receive tokens which are created by a different user account (SigChain), the user needs to create a token account first. Every token will require a unique account. To create a token account, the user will need the token's name or address.

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE:**

* Nexus accounts, such as default, trust, or any other created by the user, cannot store tokens.
* Every user has to create the particular token account to be able to transact the token.
{% endhint %}

Go to User module on the bottom bar, select the Tokens tab on the left.
