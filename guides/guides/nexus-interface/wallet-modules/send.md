# Send

To send NXS or a Token to another address, or to move NXS between your personal accounts, go to the Send module, and please follow the below instructions:

1. _**Send From:**_ Select the account to send from using the drop down list which contains all available accounts.
2. _**Send To**_: Select one of your personal accounts using the drop down list, contacts saved in your address book, or copy and paste a new payee address. Tritium enables the use of the receivers username:account (case sensitive) like in the image below Zin:default (ZIN is the username and default is the account), this makes it easy for new users to transact and also avoids mistakes when copying the hex address.
3. _**Amount:**_ Enter the NXS or Token quantity you would like to send.
4. _**Reference Number:**_ Add an optional reference, invoice or order number.
