# How to Unstake

> **Note:** Stop Staking is not the same as unstaking NXS. Staked coins are locked in a trust account and will not be available until properly unstaked.

* Unstaking NXS will slash the users stake rate and trust.
* To unstake, go to the “_User_” module at the bottom, click on “_Staking_” tab on the left. On the right, it shows you the staking details.
* Click "_Adjust stake Amount_", and enter the amount to keep staking. For example, the wallet is staking 25K NXS and there is a need to remove 10K, then enter 15K. If the entire balance needs to be withdrawn, enter 0. Click "_Set staking amount_" to save the changes.
* The changes will be reflected in the stake details, continue staking and on the next stake block the NXS will be unlocked and available in the trust account under "_Available Balance_".
* The unstaked NXS can now be sent to another account. If you have withdrawn your entire balance then you can stop staking.
