# Create a Global Name

This guide will help users to create a **Global Name** using the Nexus Interface. Before we start to create a **Global Name**, users need to be familiar with the concept and usage.

## Global Name:

Global Names require no username or namespace prefix, and are therefore globally unique. These will be likely reserved for use cases where a succinct, unique, name is necessary, for example a token ticker symbol. To avoid needless name-squatting, global names attract a fee of `2000 NXS`.

## Uses of Global Name:

The best use-case of a  Global name will be as token tickers. With the P2P marketplace, this will be a very helpful to have a global ticker for the token, which will make it easy to list and also to be easily recognised by users.

Tokens can be traded without a global name, but they will be addressed by the register address which is not recommended, as it will not be easily distinguished by users.&#x20;


## Tritium++:

> In Tritium++ when user creates a token a `global name` is created by default, if the `name` parameter is provided.

## Global Name Parameters:

The parameters required to create a global name.

### Name Field

In this field the user provides the global name to be created.

### Register Address

In this field the user provides the register address of the token that will be linked to the global name.&#x20;

## Create a Name:

To create a Name using the Interface follow the steps:

* Open the Nexus Interface, make sure the wallet is fully synched and log into the user account (Sigchain).
* In the Overview page, at the bottom click on the "_User"_ module. This opens the User page.
* In the User page, on the left side click on the "_Names_" tab.
* In the Names page click on "_Create a new name_". This opens the _Create a new name_ page.
* On top of the page make sure the "GLOBAL" button is highlighted, if not click on it.&#x20;
* In this page the user has to provide the "Name" and the "register address" to which it points .&#x20;
* Once the parameters are provided, click on the "CREATE NAME" button on the bottom of the page.
* The data will be sent to the network for verification and when the transaction is confirmed, the newly created global name will appear in the list.
