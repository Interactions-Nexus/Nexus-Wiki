# Minimum Staking Amount


> Approximately 20-25K NXS (April 2022).
{.is-info}

The minimum threshold varies every few minutes as staking difficulty changes. The only way to know for sure is to start staking. If no blocks are found within a reasonable time, add more NXS to trust balance and adjust the staking amount. This is the equivalent of adding more Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to a PoW mining rig. The minimum amount is an estimation, a ballpark approximation depending on community participation and ecosystem adoption. Additional clarification is provided below:

* Nexus staking incentive is a product of the total number of staking NXS and node trust (elapsed time spent securing the network).
* When the node starts staking, trust is minimal. For example, 20K NXS is sent to a trust account, after the coin matures for 72 hours, it takes a few days to generate a genesis which is your first stake transaction that locks your NXS in the trust account.
* The node may not be able to stake the next block before 72 hours (Block Weight = 100%). Don’t be alarmed, continue staking and over time the duration between new stake blocks decreases, and a block may be found within the 72 hour deadline.
* Remain persistent, continue staking at least for 3 months, before you decide to quit (if you wait longer your chances increase). In the meantime the stake amount can be increased.


> **NOTE:** If planning to stake all the NXS balance, understand that when unstaking in part or in full,  there will be a penalty on trust and stake rate.
{.is-warning}

Ex: If a user is staking 50,000 NXS, after a year he reaches 3% stake rate and he unstakes 50% ie 25,000 NXS the stake rate will drop to 1.5% immediately as the stake adjustment is confirmed.

> Trust earned by staking beyond a year of continuous staking is recorded as *trust* onchain, even though the 'trust score' is limited to 100.
