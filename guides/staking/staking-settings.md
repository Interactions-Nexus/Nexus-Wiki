# Staking Settings

The Nexus wallet is enabled for staking by default. No setting adjustments are required initially.

Go to the “Settings” module on the bottom, click on the “Core” tab and locate the toggle button to enable/disable staking. (Follow highlighted icons & text in image below).

Staking can be stopped or started from the “User” module at the bottom bar. Click the “Staking” tab on the left, then find the “Stop Staking” button on the right. Once selected the core will restart and now show the “Start Staking” button.
